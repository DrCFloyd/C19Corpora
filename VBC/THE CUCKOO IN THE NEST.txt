                        THE CUCKOO IN THE NEST                           BY MRS. OLIPHANT                           CHAPTER I.The Seven Thorns was rather an imposing place for a little country inn.It was a long house, not very high, yet containing some good-sizedbedrooms on the upper storey, and rooms below calculated for theentertainment of a much greater company than ever appeared now upon thedeserted highroad. It had been an old coaching road, and there werestables at the Seven Thorns which could take in half the horses in thecounty; but that, of course, was all over now. The greater part of thesestables were shut up and falling into decay. So was the largedining-room and half of the extensive accommodation downstairs. Thegreat kitchen, and a little room on the other side of the doorway, whichwas called the parlour, were all that was ever wanted now in the SevenThorns. Sometimes there would come some excursion parties from theneighbouring town in summer, and then a large table was placed outside,or, on the emergency of a wet day, in the kitchen. This was the onlyevent which ever broke the quiet in these degenerate days.The usual traffic was confined to the village; to now and then apedestrian jogging along on foot, sometimes a tramp, sometimes atourist; or to a farmer going by to market, who remembered the day whenthe Hewitts of the Seven Thorns were as substantial a family as his own.It was a house which had come down in the world, with a downfall asgreatly felt, as much rebelled against, as the fall of the proudestfamily in the county could have been. The Hewitts had no pretension tobe gentry, but they had been yeomen, farming their own land, and givinga large and well-paid hospitality to man and beast, which involvedlittle that was menial to the family itself. The Richard Hewitt of theday had stood with his hands in his pockets, on his own threshold,talking to his guests about public matters, or the affairs of thecounty, while his ostlers looked after the horses, and his buxom maid,or rough waiter, brought the gentlemen their beer or more potentdraught. He did not touch either horse or glass, but admired the one orshared the other, like any other rustic potentate; and if his prettydaughter glanced out of an upstairs window upon the group at the door,Sir Giles himself would take off his cap, and though perhaps there mightbe a touch of extravagance in the obeisance, which meant, in hisintention, that Patty or Polly was not in the least upon his own level,yet the Patty or Polly of the moment remained completely unconscious ofthat exaggeration, and blushed, and retired from the window with adelighted sensation of being admired by the gentleman who was always socivil. Alas! these fine days were all past: and when Patience Hewitt nowswept out the parlour briskly, as she did everything, and threw freshwholesome sand upon the floor, and brought in the beer which the youngsquire, loitering upon the forbidden threshold of the great kitchen,had already several times asked for, the sense of that downfall was asstrong in her mind as if she had been the old aunt Patty, old as theworld itself, the girl thought, to whom old Sir Giles had taken off hiscap.“Patty! Patty! bring us some beer; and be done with that sweepin’, andcome, there’s a ducky, and pour it out yourself.”“Go to the parlour, Mr. Gervase; that’s your place and not here. If youwill have beer in the morning, which is so bad for you, I’ll bring itpresently; but you know father won’t have you here.”“If you’ll have me, I don’t mind old Hewitt, not that!” said Gervase,snapping his thumb and forefinger.“But I do,” said Patience, with a frown. “Old Hewitt is my father, andthose that don’t speak respectful of him had better get out of here, andout of there, too. I won’t have a man in the house that don’t know howto behave himself, if he was a dozen times the squire’s son.”The young man in question was a lanky youth, long and feeble upon hislegs, with light hair longer than is usual, and goggle eyes, in whichthere was no speculation. He was very much cowed by Patty’s energeticdisapproval, and looked as if about to cry.“Don’t go on at me like that, Patty, don’t, now! I’ll swallow oldHewitt, dirty boots and all, before I’ll have you frown. And do, dohave done with your sweepin’ and bring us the beer. I never feel rightin the morning till I have had my beer.”“If you didn’t have too much at night, Mr. Gervase, you wouldn’t want itin the morning.”“Well, and whose fault is that? I’ll drink no more beer. I’ve promisedyou, if----”“If!” said Patty: “it’s a big ‘if.’ If I’ll take you up on my shoulders,that ain’t fit for such a job, and carry you through the world.”“Come, that’s too bad,” said the young man. “Do you think I can’t takecare of my own wife! I never had any intentions that weren’t honourable,and that you well know.”“You well know,” cried Patty, with a flush of anger, “that the meresaying you hadn’t is enough for me to bundle you neck-and-crop out ofthis house, and never to speak to you again.”“Well!” said poor Gervase, “you’re hard to please. If he can’t say thathe means well, I don’t know what a fellow may say.”“If I were in your place, I’d say as little as possible,” said the maidof the inn.“What a one you are!” cried the young squire, admiringly. “When we’remarried I’ll let you do all the talking. You’ll bring round the fatherand mother a deal sooner than I should. Indeed, they never hearken tome; but, Patty, when you speak----”“What happens when I speak?”“The very rector turns round his head. I’ve seen him do it at the churchdoor.”“Pooh! the rector!” said Patty. “Tell me something a little fresher thanthat.”For, in fact, this young woman scorned the rector as one whom she couldturn round her little finger. Had not she, ever since the days when shewas the quickest at her catechism, the readiest to understandeverything, the sharpest to take any hint, the most energetic in action,been known as the rector’s favourite and ally in all parish matters formiles around?“Is that all you think of him? but he’s of as good a family as we are;and I shouldn’t wonder,” said the young man, with a giggle, “if Mrs.Bethell were to die, as folk say, that he mightn’t come a-wooing toPatty, of the Seven Thorns, same as me.”“I should like to know,” said Patty, sharply, “what kind of companyyou’ve been keeping, where they dare to speak of me as Patty of theSeven Thorns? And I suppose you didn’t knock the fellow down that saidit, you poor creature! you’re not man enough for that, though I knowsome----” said Patty, with an air of defiance. She had by this timecarried out all her operations, and even drawn the beer, and waved offthe thirsty customer before her, driving him, as if he had been a flockof geese, into the parlour, with its newly-sanded floor.“There!” she said, setting down her tray with a little violence; “it’sgood stuff enough, but it puts no more heart and strength into you thanif you was a mouse. Too much is as bad, or maybe worse, than none atall. And, I tell you, I know some that would no more hear me nameddisrespectful like that--or any way but Miss Hewitt, Mr. Hewitt of theSeven Thorns’ daughter--than I would demean myself to carrying on likea barmaid with every one that comes for a glass of beer into thishouse.”“I beg your pardon, Patty,” said the young man; “I meant no harm. Whenyou’re Mrs. Gervase Piercey there’s never one of them will dare mentionyour name without taking off his hat.”“Oh, you block!” cried Patty, exasperated. She paused, however, with anevident sense that to make her meaning clear to him would be impossible;yet added, after a moment, “If I can’t be respected as Miss Hewitt, I’llnever seek respect under no man’s name. There’s your beer, Mr. Gervase;and as soon as you’ve drunk it I advise you to go back to your parents,for you’ll get no more here.”“Oh! Patty, don’t you be so cruel.”“I’ll be as cruel as I think proper. And I’ll draw father’s beer forthem as I think proper, and nobody else. You’re the spoiled child at theHall, Mr. Gervase, but no one cares _that_ for you here!”And she, too, snapped her thumb and forefinger, in scorn of anysubjection to ordinary prejudices, and shone radiant, in her defiance,in the homely scene to which she gave so much life. Patty was not abeautiful girl, as perhaps you may suppose. She had bright eyes, verywell able to flash with indignation when necessary, or even with rage.She had a fine country complexion, with the gift, which is not so usualamong the lowly born, of changing colour as her sentiments changed:flashing forth in wrath, and calming down in peace; and when she wasexcited, with an angry sparkle in her eyes, and the colour rising andfalling, there was a _faux air_ of beauty about her, which impressed theminds of those who exposed themselves to any such blaze of resentment.Her features, however, were not very good, and there was a hardness inthe lines, which, no doubt, would strengthen in later years. She had atrim figure, a brisk light step, an air of knowing her own mind, andfully intending to carry out all its purposes, which made a greatimpression upon the shiftless and languid generally, and upon GervasePiercey in particular. Perhaps Patty had a little too much the air, inher sharp intelligence, of the conventional _soubrette_, to have charmeda squire’s son of greater intellectual perceptions. But Gervase knewnothing about _soubrettes_, or any other types, theatrical or otherwise.He knew vaguely what he saw, but no more; and that sharp intelligence,that brisk energy, that air of knowing her own mind, was morecaptivating to him than anything he had ever seen. He, whom everybodysnubbed, who was accustomed to be laughed at, who knew so much as toknow that he never knew what to do until somebody told him, and oftendid not understand what was wanted of him then--threw himself upon Pattywith all the heavy weight of his nature. He had never seen anything soadmirable, so strong, or so fair. She never was afraid to do whatevershe had a mind to. She never stood swaying from one foot to anotherunable to make up her mind. She was all swiftness, firmness,alertness--ready for anything. He almost liked her to be angry with him,though it sometimes reduced him to abject despair, for the sake of thatsparkle, that flush, that exhibition of high spirit. Nobody, Gervasefelt, would “put upon him” while Patty was near; nobody would push himaside, bid him to get out of the way. Even his father did this; and,what was still more, his mother too, when exasperated. But they wouldnot, if Patty was there. Gervase was not only in love with her, which hewas to the full extent of his abilities in that way, but he felt thathis salvation lay in Patty, and that, with her to back him up, nobodywould trample upon him any more.He hoped to find her in a milder humour when he came back in theevening; for in the meantime it was beyond anything he could say or doto charm Patty back into good humour. She went back to her sweeping,making the corners of the kitchen floor ring with the energetic broomthat pursued every grain of dust into its last refuge there. She wouldnot stop, even to say good morning to him, when he lounged away. Butafter he was gone Patty relaxed in her fierce industry. She put away thebroom, and stood at the window for a moment, with deep thought upon herbrow. What was it she was thinking of, bending those brows, drawing inher upper lip in a way she had when her mind was busy? “To be, or not tobe,” that was the question. She was far, very far, from a Hamlet; butthat momentous choice was before her, as much as if she had been themightiest of spirits. When a woman pauses thus upon the threshold ofher life, and questions which path she is to take, it is generally easyto guess that the question really is, which man will she marry? Pattywas full of ambition as if she had been a princess. And she felt trulyas much the child of a fallen house as if Richard Hewitt of the SevenThorns had been a ruined duke. How far, how very far was she, Patience,the maid of the inn, drawing beer for the customers, compelled to serveevery tramp who had twopence to spend--from the state of young MissPatty at the upstairs window, sitting like a lady, doing vandykes oftape for her new petticoats (for she was informed of every incident ofthose times of family grandeur), to whom Sir Giles took off his hat. Shehad heard all her life of these once glorious circumstances, and herspirit burned within her to do something to restore herself thateminence; to achieve something that would make Aunt Patty hold hertongue, and own herself outdone. Ah! and here it was lying in her power.Sir Giles might have bowed to old Patty, but never did she have it inher power to become Lady Piercey, if she chose. Lady Piercey! withGreyshott Manor at her command, and all the grandeur which the verybest of the previous Hewitts had only seen by grace of the housekeeper.And Patty might one day be the mistress of the housekeeper if she chose!The possibility was enough to thrill her from head to foot; but she hadnot yet made up her mind. No, splendid as the prospect was, there wasyet a great deal to think of before she could make up her mind. She wentto the door and gave a hurried glance out, to see the long, listlessfigure of Gervase Piercey strolling along across the wide stretch ofbroken land that lay between him and his home. He paused to look backseveral times as he went along, but Patty would not gratify him with thesight of her looking after him. He was not a lover to be encouraged bysuch signs of favour, but to be kept down at her feet until she shouldchoose to hold out a gracious finger. Her thoughts were not flatteringto him as she looked after him: the long, lazy, listless, useless being.If he did not care so much for me, beer would be the chief thing thatMr. Gervase would care for; coming here in the morning for his glass,the fool, instead of doing something! A man with horses to ride andcarriages to drive, and an estate that he might see to, and save hisfather money! “Lord! lord!” said Patty to herself, “what fools these menare!” for the only thing he could do with himself, to get through themorning, was to walk across to the Seven Thorns for his morning beer,and then to walk back again. She who had a hundred things to do scornedhim for this more than words could say. But yet, “first and foremost,before I settle anything,” said Patty, “I’ll see that he’s cured ofthat. A man that’s always swilling beer morning and evening, if he was aduke, he is not the man for me.”CHAPTER II.The parlour at the Seven Thorns was, in the evening, turned into a sortof village club, where a select number of the fathers of the hamletassembled night after night to consume a certain amount of beer, tosmoke a certain number of pipes, and then to retire at a not very latehour, not much the worse, perhaps, for their potations. It was not avicious place, nor was it one of revelry. The talk was slow, like theminds of the talkers, and it was chiefly concerned with local events. Ifnow and then there was a public measure which was wide enough, ordescended sufficiently low to reach the level of those rustic folk,there might be occasionally a few heavy words on that subject. But thiswas of the rarest occurrence, and the humours of the heavy assembly werelittle perceptible to a superficial observer. What was going on at theManor was of infinitely less interest to this rustic club than what wasgoing on in the village, and unless Sir Giles had turned out hiscottagers, or, what was worse, endeavoured to improve their tumble-downhabitations, I cannot see why their minds should have been directed tohim or his affairs. It is, perhaps, a delusion of the writer, mostinterested himself in the Squire’s family, which lends to the ruralpublic the same inclination. It is true that when young Gervase Pierceyfirst began to appear among them, to be placed in the warmest corner,and served first with whatever he called for, the elders of the villagetook their pipes out of their mouths and stared. “What do he bea-wanting ’ere?” they said to each other with their eyes, and a head ortwo was shaken, not only over the inappropriateness of his appearance,but because the presence of the young Squire was more or less a checkupon their native freedom as well as prolixity of talk. Gervase had beenknown to interrupt a lingering discussion with a “Speak up, old cock!”or with a silly laugh in the wrong place, which confused the speaker andmade him forget whereabouts in his subject he was. It was some time,however, before it occurred to them what the young man’s motive was,which was made plain by several signs: in the first place by the factthat Patty ceased to serve the customers in the parlour, old Hewittgetting up with many grumbles from the settle to supply their wantshimself; then by the impatience of the young man, who had at firstsmoked his pipe contentedly in his corner, interrupting the conversationonly by those silly laughs of his, or by an equally foolish question,which, though idiotic in itself, was the cause of discomfiture to avillage orator accustomed to have everything his own way; and then itwas observed that Gervase let his pipe go out and kept his eyes upon thedoor, and then that he became very uneasy when the brisk voice of Pattywas heard outside, presumably talking with the younger frequenters ofthe place, who hung about the precincts of the Seven Thorns, or occupiedthe bench under the window of the parlour. When the young squire at lastgot up and went out, the sages said little, but they looked at eachother or nudged each other, those who were close enough pointing withtheir long pipes over their shoulders, and finally burst forth into aslow roar, shaking their sides. “Softy if ’e be, ’e knows wat’s wat aswell as ere another,” said the “_Maestro de chi sanno_,” the sage ofsages, the Aristotle of the village. This revelation slowly communicateditself over the parish, “The young squire, he be after Patty Hewitt o’the Seven Thorns; but Patty is one as will keep him in his place, and nomistake,” was the popular verdict. The parish knew, even better than thegentry did, that Gervase--Sir Giles’ only child--was a softy; it knewhis habits, and that he was good for nothing, not even to take a hand atcards or field a ball at cricket, so that his dangling after PattyHewitt caused nobody any anxiety. She knew how to keep him in his ownplace; no village story of lovely woman stooping to folly was likely toarise in her case. The Softy was a good creature enough, and harmednobody, except by that exasperating laugh of his, which made the personsinterrupted by it furious, but broke no bones, everybody allowed. Sothat it was more on Gervase’s account than Patty’s that the villageconcerned itself. “She do be making a fool of ’im,” they said withgratification; for was not this a just revenge for other maidens wrongedby other young squires of higher qualities than poor Gervase. Generallythere was a slow satisfaction in the triumph of the people over thegentry, as thus exemplified; yet a general wish that Patty should notpush that triumph too far.On the evening of the day on which this story begins, he had kept in theparlour as long as his patience lasted, always looking for the momentwhen she should appear; for the mind of Gervase worked very slowly, andhe had not yet begun to understand as a rule, what all the parishalready knew, that Patty now entered the parlour no more in the evening.Gervase knew that he had not seen her for night after night, but he hadno faculty for putting this and that together, and he did not draw thenatural conclusion that she had so settled it with her father. Nor hadhe found much advantage in going out to the door, in following the soundof her voice, which seemed to flicker about like a will-o’-the-wisp, nowsounding close at hand, now from a distance. When Patty was visible shewas generally in close conversation with some one--Roger Pearson asoften as not, was an antagonist whom Gervase had sense enough not toencounter. And, accordingly, it was the most rare thing in the worldwhen he had any nearer view of the object of his admiration than the dimoutline of her, in the dark, flitting about in front of the house withher tray, and not to be interrupted; or perhaps strolling off beyond theseven thorns which gave their name to the house, with another tallfigure beside her. Roger Pearson was the athlete of the village. It washe who commanded the eleven got up between Greyshott and Windyhill,which had beaten almost every eleven that had met them, and certainlyevery other eleven in the county; and he was a leading volunteer, agreat football player, everything that it is most glorious in Englishcountry life to be. Gervase did not venture to contest openly the favourof Patty with this stalwart fellow. He stood on the threshold with hismouth open, and his heart rung, and watched them stroll away together inthe moonlight, losing sight of them in the shadow of the thorns: waitingtill they emerged beyond upon the great flat of the moorland countryamong the furze bushes. Poor Softy! to see the lady of his love thustaken away from him by a stronger than he, was very hard upon him.Though he was a Softy, there was in Gervase so much of that feeling ofthe gentleman, which can be transmitted by blood and by the atmosphereof an ancient house--as made him aware that to make his possible wifethe object of a brawl was not to be thought of, even had he felt anyconfidence in his own courage and muscles as against those of Roger. Sothat both these reasons held him back: the instinct of the weakling,and the instinct of the gentleman too. If he could have fought with andoverthrown Roger on any other argument, how he would have rejoiced! Heplanned in his dreams a hundred ways of doing so, but never in hiswaking moments ventured to cross that hero’s path: and he would not makea row over Patty. No! no! even if he could have seized Roger by thecollar and pitched him to the other side of the moor, as Roger, he wasconvinced, would do to him if the opportunity ever arose, he would nothave done it to bring in Patty’s name and make her talked about. No! no!He said this to himself as he stood at the door and watched them withhis mouth open and watering, and his heart sore. Poor Gervase; there wassomething in it, even if not so much as he thought.But this evening, by a happy chance, Roger was not there. Gervase foundPatty standing alone, wholly indifferent to the two or three vaguefigures which were dimly visible on the bench beneath the lighted windowof the parlour. It was such a chance for Gervase as had never happenedbefore. He whistled softly, but Patty took no notice; he called her byher name in a whisper, but she never turned her head. Was she regrettingthe other man, the fellow who had nothing to offer her but a cottage,and who was far too busy with his cricket matches and things ever toearn much money, or even to stay at home with his wife? Gervase venturedupon a great step. He came up behind her and seized Patty’s hand, whichwas akimbo, firmly placed upon her side.“Who’s that?” she cried, throwing off the touch; “and what are youwanting here?”“You know well enough who it is--it’s Gervase come to have a word----”“Oh!” said Patty, disdainfully, “it’s the young gentleman from the Manoras has no right to be here.”“Yes, it is me,” said Gervase, not quick enough to take up the scorn inher speech. “Come, Patty, let’s take a little turn round the Thorns: do,now!--there’s nobody else coming to-night.”“Much I care for any one coming! I can take my walk alone, thank you,Mr. Gervase, and you had better go home. I can’t abide to see youspending your time here morning and night.”“Why shouldn’t I come here, Patty? It is the nicest place in all theworld to me.”“But it oughtn’t to be,” cried Patty; “your place is in Greyshott Manor,and this is only a little inn upon the edge of the downs. What pleasurecan you find in this parlour, with all their pipes going, and the smokecurling about your head, and the silly talk about Blacksmith John at thesmithy, and how he shod Farmer George’s mare?”“Well, if I don’t object to the talk; and what reason have you againstit? It’s always good for trade.”“It’s not even good for trade,” said the girl. “Do you think they likeyou to be here, these men? No; not even father don’t, though it’s to hisprofit, as you say. It stops the talk: for there’s things they wouldn’tsay before you: and it makes them think and ask questions. It ain’tpleasant for me when they takes to ask each other, ‘What’s the youngsquire after for ever down here?’”“Well, you can tell them,” said Gervase, with his foolish laugh; “I makeno secret of it. Patty’s what I’m after, and she knows----”They had gone down upon the open ground where the seven thorns, whichgave the house it’s name, stood in a cluster, ghostly in the whitemoonlight, some of them so old that they were propped up by staves andheavy pieces of wood. Patty had moved on in the fervour of her speech,notwithstanding that she angrily rejected his request to take a turn.With the blackness of that shade between them and the house, they mighthave been miles, though they were but a few yards, from the house, withits murmuring sound of voices and its lights.“Look here!” said Patty, quickly. “No man shall ever come after me thatgoes boozing like you do at beer from morning to night.”Patty, though she generally spoke very nicely, thanks to the Catechismand the rector’s favour, was after all not an educated person, and ifshe said “like you do,” it was no more than might be expected from herignorance. She flung away the arm which he had stolen round her, andwithdrew to a distance, facing him with her head erect. “You’re adreadful one for beer, Mr. Gervase,” she said; “it’s that you come toour house for, it isn’t for me. If there was no Patty, you’d want aplace to sit and soak in all the same.”“That’s a lie!” said the young man; “and I don’t take more than I wantwhen I’m thirsty. It’s only you that are contrary. There’s that Roger;you let him have as much as you like----”“What Roger?” cried Patty, with a flash of her eyes, which was visibleeven in the moonlight. “If it’s Mr. Pearson you mean, he never looks atbeer except just to stand pots round for the good of the house----”“If that’s what pleases you, Patty, I’ll--I’ll stand anything--toanybody--as long as--as long as----” Poor Gervase thrust the hand whichshe would not permit to hold hers, into his pocket, searching for thecoin that he had not. At which his tormentor laughed.“As long as you’ve anything to pay it with,” she said. “And you havenot--and that makes all the difference. Roger Pearson--since you’ve madeso bold as to put a name to him--has his pockets full. And you’rerunning up a pretty high score, Mr. Gervase, I can tell you, for nobodybut yourself.”“I don’t know how he has his pockets full,” Gervase said, with a growl;“it isn’t from the work he does--roaming the country and playing inevery match----”“You see he _can_ play,” said Patty, maliciously; “which some folkscouldn’t do, not if they was to try from now to doomsday.”“But it don’t get him on in his business, or make money to keep awife,” said the young man with a flash of shrewdness, at which Pattystared with astonishment, but with a touch of additional respect.“Well, Mr. Gervase,” she said, making a swift diversion; “I shall alwayssay it’s a shame keeping you as short as you are of money; and you theheir of all.”“Isn’t it?” cried Sir Giles Piercey’s heir. “Not a penny but what’sdoled out as if I were fifteen instead of twenty-five--or I’d havebrought you diamonds, before now, Patty, to put round your neck.”“Would you, now, Mr. Gervase? And what good would they have been to meat the Seven Thorns? You can’t wear diamonds when you’re drawing beer,”she added, with a laugh.“I can’t abide you to be drawing beer,” cried the young man: “unlesswhen it is for me.”“And that’s the worst I can do,” said Patty, quickly. “Here’s just howit is: till you give up all that beer, Mr. Gervase, you’re not the manfor me. It’s what I begun with, and you’ve brought me round to it again.Him as I’ve to do with shall never be like that. Father sells it--more’sthe pity; but I don’t hold with it. And, if I had the power, not a womanin the country would look at a man that was fond of it: more than forhis meals, and, perhaps, a drop when he’s thirsty,” she added, in a moresubdued tone.“That’s just my case, Patty,” said Gervase; “a drop when I’mthirsty--and most often I am thirsty----”“That’s not what I mean, neither. If you were up and down from morningto night getting in your hay, or seeing to your turnips, or riding tomarket--well, then I’d allow you a drink, like as I would to your horse,only the brute has the most sense, and drinks good water; but roaming upand down, doing nothing as you are--taking a walk for the sake ofgetting a drink, and then another walk to give you the excuse to comeback again, and nothing else in your mind but how soon you can getanother; and then sitting at it at night for hours together till you’reall full of it--like a wet sponge, and smelling like the parlour does inthe morning before the windows are opened--Faugh!” cried Patty,vigorously pushing him away, “it is enough to make a woman sick!”Personal disgust is the one thing which nobody can bear; even the abjectGervase was moved to resentment. “If I make you sick, I’d better go,” hesaid sullenly, “and find another place where they ain’t so squeamish.”“Yes, do; there are plenty of folks that don’t mind: neither for yourgood nor for their own feelings. You can go, and welcome. And I’m goingback to the house.”“Oh, stop a moment, Patty! Don’t take a fellow up so quick! It isn’tnice to hear a girl say that, when you worship the ground she standson----”“The smell of beer,” said Patty, sniffing audibly with her nostrils inthe air, “is what I never could abide.”“You oughtn’t to mind it. If it wasn’t for beer----”“Oh, taunt me with it, do!” cried Patty. “If it wasn’t for beer, neitherRichard Hewitt of the Seven Thorns, nor them that belongs to him, thatonce had their lands and their farms as good as any one, and more horsesin their stables than you have ever had at the Manor, couldn’t get onat all, nor pay their way--Oh, taunt me with it! It’s come to that, andI can’t gainsay it. I draw beer for my living, and I ought to encouragethem that come. But I can’t abide it, all the same,” cried Patty,stamping her foot on the dry and sandy turf; “and I won’t look at a man,if he was a prince, that is soaking and drinking night and day!”She turned and walked off towards the house with her quick, springystep, followed by the unhappy Gervase, who called “Patty! Patty!” byintervals, as he went after humbly. At last, just before they came intosight of the loungers about the door, he ventured to catch at hersleeve.“Patty! Patty! just for one moment! Listen--do listen to me!”“What were you pleased to want, sir?” said Patty, turning upon him.“Another tankard of beer?”“Oh, Patty,” said the young man, “if I was to give it up, and nevertouch another blessed drop again----”“It would be real good for you--the very best thing you could do.”“I wasn’t thinking of that. Would you be a little nice to me, Patty?Would you listen to me when I speak?--would you----?”“I always listen to them that speaks sense, Mr. Gervase.”“I know I ain’t clever,” said the poor fellow; “and whether this issense I don’t know: but you shall be my lady when father dies, if you’llonly listen to me now.”Patty’s eyes danced, and her pulses beat with a thrill which ran throughher from head to foot. But she said:“I’ll never listen to any man, if he would make me a queen, so long ashe went on like that with the beer!”CHAPTER III.Greyshott Manor, to which Gervase directed his steps after theinterview above recorded, was a large red brick mansion, no earlier thanthe reign of Anne; though there were traces in various parts of thehouse of a much older lineage. The front, however, which you could seethrough the wonderful avenue of beeches, which was the pride of theplace, bore a pediment and twinkled with rows of windows, two long linesabove the porticoed and pillared door, which also had a small pedimentof its own. It looked old-fashioned, but not old, and was in perfectrepair. When the sun shone down the beech avenue, which faced to thewest, it turned the old bricks of the house into a sort of glorifiedruddiness, blended of all the warmest tones--red and russet, and brownand orange, with a touch of black relieving it here and there. Theeffect in autumn, when all those warm tints which, by the alchemy ofnature, bring beauty out of the chilly frost and unlovely decay--was asif all the colours in the rainbow had been poured forth; but all sotoned and subdued by infinite gradation that the most violent notes ofcolour were chastened into harmony. It was not autumn, however, at thismoment, but full summer,--the trees in clouds and billows of fullfoliage, dark on either side of that glory of the moon, which poureddown like a silver river between, and made all the windows white withthe whiteness of her light. The avenue was a wonderful feature atGreyshott, and even the mere passer-by had the good of it, since it wasclosed only by a great gate of wrought iron, which would also have beenworth looking at had the spectator been a connoisseur. The fault of theavenue was that it was a short one--not above a quarter of a milelong--and it was now used only by foot-passengers, who had a right ofway through the little postern that flanked the big gate. Importantvisitors drove up on the other side, through what was called _the_Avenue, which was just like other avenues; but the Beeches were thepride of Greyshott. To think that the one slim shadow that came into themoonlight in the midst of them, with a wavering gait and stoopingshoulders, should be the future lord and master of all those princelyolder inhabitants, with the power of life and death in his hands! A fewyears hence, when old Sir Giles had come to the end of his existence,his son could cut them down if he pleased. He could obliterate the veryname of the great trees, so much more dignified and splendid members ofsociety than himself, which stood in close ranks on either side of thepath: he so little and they so great, and yet this confused andbewildered mortal the master of all!If Gervase walked with a wavering gait, it was not because of the beeragainst which Patty had made so strong a remonstrance. He had, indeed,had quite enough of that; but his uncertain step was natural to theSofty, as all the country called him. He went along with his headstooping, his hands in his pockets, his eyes traversing the path as wellas his feet, keeping up an inane calculation of the white pebbles, orthe brown ones, among the gravel. He had long been in the habit ofplaying a sort of game with himself in the vacancy of his mind, thebrown against the white, counting them all along the level of the road,occasionally cheating himself in the interests of the right side or theleft. This occupation had beguiled him over many a mile of road. But ithad palled upon him since he had known Patty, or rather, since she hadsurprised him into that admiration and enthusiasm which had made himdetermine to marry her, whatever difficulties might be in the way. Itwas, perhaps, because of the rebuff she had given him that Gervase hadagain taken to his game with the brown and white pebbles in the road,which, indeed, it was not too easy to distinguish in the whiteness ofthe moon. He walked along with his head down, his hands in his pockets,his shoulders up to his ears, and the moon was very unhandsome in thematter of shadow, and threw a villainous blotch behind him upon thatclear white line of way. There was a light in the front of the house towhich Gervase was bound; a sort of querulous light, which shone keen inthe expanse of windows, all black and white in the moon, like the eyesof an angry watcher looking out for the return of the prodigal, but notlike the father in the parable. It was, indeed, exactly so: the lightwas in his mother’s window, who would not go to bed till Gervase hadcome home. It was not late, but it was late for the rural household,which was all closed and shut up by ten o’clock. Sir Giles was aninvalid, his wife old, and accustomed to take great care of herself. Shesat up in her dressing-gown, angry, though anxious, with all thereproachful dignity of a woman kept up and deprived of her natural rest,ready to step into bed the moment her vigil was over; a large watchticking noisily and also reproachfully on the table beside her, with asort of stare in its large white face, seeming to say, late! late!instead of tick, tick--to the young man’s guilty ear.At least, it had once done so; but Gervase by this time was quitehardened to the watch that said late! and the mother whose tongue in thetschick, tschick! of angry remonstrance, hailed him for want of betterwelcome when he went in.He directed himself to a little side door in the shadow, which was oftenleft open for him by the old butler, who had less fear of his platethan of getting the boy, whom, Softy as he was, he loved, into trouble.But sometimes it was not left open; sometimes an emissary from above,his mother’s maid, who loved him not, one of her satellites, turned thekey, and Gervase had to ring, waking all the echoes of the house. Hethought it was going to be so on this particular night, for when hepushed, it did not yield. Next moment, however, it opened softly,showing a tall shadow in the dimly-lighted passage. “O, Gervase, howlate you are!” said a low voice.“Why, it’s you!” he said.“Yes, it’s me. My aunt is angry, I don’t know why. And she says you areto go to her before you go to bed.”“I sha’n’t!” said Gervase.“Do, there’s a dear boy. She has got something in her head. She willimagine worse than the truth if you don’t go. Oh! why should you be soundutiful? They would be so good to you if you would but let them. Go toyour mother, Gervase, and let her see----”She paused, looking at him by the faint light as if she were not verysure that Gervase’s mother would see anything satisfactory. There wasnot, indeed, anything exhilarating to see. His light eyes, which hadshone with a certain brightness upon Patty, were opaque now, and had nospeculation in them. His under lip hung a little, and was always moist.The sullen look was habitual to his face. “What does she want o’ me?” hesaid in his throat, running his words into each other.“She wants of you---- what I’m afraid she’ll never get,” said the cousinwith a tone of exasperation; “but at least go and say good-night to her,Gervase, and be as pleasant as you can. You may always do that.”“You’re not one that thinks much o’ my pleasantness, Meg.”“I’ve always been grateful for it when you’ve showed me any,” she saidwith a smile. She was a tall woman, older than Gervase, a few years overthirty, at the age which should be the very glory and flush of prime,but which in a woman is usually scoffed at as if it were old age.Gervase frankly thought his cousin an elderly woman who did not countany longer in life. She was very plainly dressed in black, being a widowand poor, and had something of the air of one who is on sufferance in ahouse to which she does not naturally belong. She kept at a slightdistance from her cousin, taking half a step back when he took one inadvance: but her voice to him was soft and her meaning kind. She had nogreat affection, beyond the habitual bond of having known him all hislife, for Gervase; but she was a bystander seeing both sides of thequestion, and she did not think that the treatment adopted in his homewas judicious, which made her more or less, as a dependent may be, thepartizan of the poor fellow, for whom nobody had any respect, and fewpeople cared at all.“Come,” she said, in a persuasive tone; “I’ll go with you, Gervase.”“What good’ll that do?” he said, sullenly.“Well, not much, perhaps: but you always liked when you were little tohave somebody to stand by you: and if my aunt thinks I’m intruding, itwill be all the better for you.”So saying, she led the way upstairs, and knocked lightly at a door onthe gallery which went round the hall. “Here he is, aunt,” she said,“quite safe and sound; and now you can get to bed.”“Who is quite safe and sound? and was there any doubt on that subject?”said a voice within. Lady Piercey sat very upright in an old-fashionedchair of the square high-backed kind, with walls like a house. Thecandle that looked so querulous in the window had inside a sharp,self-assertive light, as if it had known all about it all the time. Shewas in a dressing-gown of a large shawl pattern, warm and wadded, andhad a muslin cap with goffered frills tied closely round her face. It isa kind of head-dress which makes a benign face still more benign, and asweet complexion sweeter, and which also stiffens and starches adifferent kind of countenance. Lady Piercey was high featured, of thattype of the human visage which resembles a horse, and her frillsquivered with the indignation in her soul.“I thought you were anxious about Gervase, aunt.”Mrs. Osborne interfered in this obviously injudicious way, with theobject of drawing aside the lightnings upon herself, as it was generallyeasy to do.“I don’t know what you had to do with it,” said Lady Piercey, roughly.“If I’m anxious about Gervase, it’s not about life or limb. I’m not afool, I hope. What did you give her, you block, to make her come and putherself before you like this?”“I’ve got nothing to give,” said the lout. There had been a trace ofmanhood, a gleam even of the gentleman in him when he was with Patty.Here, in his mother’s room, he became a mere lump of clay. He pulled outhis pockets as he spoke, which shed a number of small articles upon thefloor, but not a coin. “I have a deal to give--to her or any one,” hesaid.“Where do you spend it all?” said the mother; “five shillings I gave youon Monday, and what expenses have you? Kept in luxury, and never needingto put your hand in your pocket. Goodness, Meg, what a smell! Is it abarrel of beer you’ve rolled into my room, or is it--is it my only boy?”“By--Gosh!” said Gervase. He could not be gentlemanly even in his oaths.He would have said “By George!” or perhaps “By Jove!” even if he hadbeen with Patty, but nothing but this vulgar expletive would come tohis lips here.“I’ve heard of you, sir,” said Lady Piercey; “I’ve heard where you spendyour time, and who you spend it with. A common beerhouse, and the womanthat serves the beer. Oh, good gracious! good gracious! and to thinkthat should be my son, and that he’s the heir to an old estate and willbe Sir Gervase if he lives!”“Ay,” said Gervase, with a laugh, “and you can’t stop that, old lady,not if you should burst.”“Don’t you be too sure I can’t stop it,” she cried. “Your father is notmuch good, but he is more good than you think; and if you supposethere’s no way of putting an idiot out of the line, you’re mistaken.There are plenty of asylums for fools, I can tell you; and if you aresuch a double-dyed fool as that----”Gervase stared and grew pale; but then he took courage and laughed aweak laugh. “I may be a fool,” he said, “you’re always that nice to me,mamma: but there’s them in the world that will stand up for me, andcleverer than you.”Lady Piercey stared also for a moment; and then turning to Mrs. Osborne,asked, “Meg! what does the ass mean?”“Oh, have a little patience, aunt! He means--nothing, probably. He hasbeen doing no harm, and he’s vexed to be blamed. Why should he be blamedwhen he has been doing no harm?”“Do you call it no harm to bring the smell of an alehouse into my room?”cried Lady Piercey; “you will have to open all the windows to get rid ofit, and probably I shall get my death of cold--which is what he wouldlike, no doubt.”Gervase laughed again, his lower lip more watery than ever. “Trust youfor taking care of yourself,” he said. “If that’s all you have got tosay, slanging a fellow for nothing, I’ll go to bed.”“Stop here, when I tell you! and let me know this instant about thatwoman. Who is she that will have anything to say to _you_? Perhaps shethinks she will be my lady, and get my place after me--a girl that drawsbeer for all the ploughmen in the parish!”“I don’t know who you’re speaking of,” said Gervase. His face grew adull red, and he clenched his fist. “By Gosh! and if she marries me, soshe will, and nobody can stop it,” he said.“You had better banish this illusion from your mind,” said Lady Piercey,with solemnity. “A woman like that shall never be my lady, and comeafter me. It’s against--against the laws of this house; it’s against thelaw of the land. Your father can leave every penny away from you! And asfor the name, it’s--it’s forbidden to a common person. The LordChancellor will not allow it!--the Queen will not have it! You might aswell try to--to bring down St. Paul’s to Greyshott! Do you hear, youfool, what I say?”Gervase stood with his mouth open: he was confounded with these bignames. The Queen and the Lord Chancellor and St. Paul’s! They mingledtogether in a something stupendous, an authority before which evenPatty, with all her cleverness, must fail. He gazed at his mother withthe stupid alarm which all his life her denunciations had inspired. St.Paul’s and the Queen! The one an awful shadow, coming down on the moors;the other at the head of her army, as in a fairy story. And the LordChancellor! something more alarming still, because Gervase could form noidea of him unless by the incarnation of the police, which even inGreyshott was a name of fear.“Look here,” said Lady Piercey, “this is what it would mean; youwouldn’t have a penny; you’d have to draw the beer yourself to get yourliving; you’d be cut off from your father’s will like--like a turniptop. The Lord Chancellor would grant an injunction to change your name;for they won’t have good old names degraded, the great officers won’t.You might think yourself lucky if you kept the Gervase, for that’s yourchristened name; but it would be Gervase Brown, or Green, orsomething;--or they might let you for a favour take her name--thebeerhouse woman’s; which would suit you very well, for you would be thebeerhouse man.”Gervase’s lip dropped more and more, his face grew paler and paler. LadyPiercey by long experience had grown versed in this kind of argument.She was aware that she could reduce him to absolute vacuity and silenceevery plea he might bring forth. He had no plea, poor fellow. He was soignorant that, often as he had been thus threatened, he never had foundout the absurdity of these threats. He fell upon himself like a ruinedwall, as he stood before her limp and terrified. There was a grim sortof humour in the woman which enjoyed this too, as well as the sense ofabsolute power she had over him; and when she had dismissed him, whichshe did with the slight touch of a kiss upon his cheek, but again agrimace at the smell of beer, she burst into a wild but suppressedlaugh. “Was there ever such a fool, to believe all I say?” she said toher niece who removed her dressing-gown, and helped her into bed; andthen--for this fierce old lady was but an old woman after all--she fella-whimpering and crying. “And that’s my son! oh Lord! my only child; allthat I’ve got in the world.”CHAPTER IV.Margaret found Gervase waiting for her in the darkness of the corridor,when she left his mother. Lady Piercey was a righteous woman, who wouldnot keep her maid out of bed after ten o’clock; but her niece was adifferent matter. He caught his cousin by the arm, almost bringing fromher a cry of alarm. “Meg,” he said in her ear, “do you think it’s alltrue?”“Oh, Gervase, you gave me such a fright!”“Is it all true?”“How can I tell you? I don’t know anything about the law,” she said,with a sense of disloyalty to the poor fellow who was so ignorant; butshe could not contradict her aunt, and if that was supposed to be forhis good----“If it should be,” said Gervase, with a deep sigh: and then he added, “Icouldn’t let her marry me if it wasn’t to be for her good.”“Oh, Gervase, why can’t you show yourself like that to _them_?” hiscousin said.“I don’t know what you mean. I make no difference,” he answered dully,as he turned away.Then there came another disturbance. The door of Sir Giles’ room furtheron opened cautiously, and his servant, who was also his nurse, lookedout with great precaution and beckoned to her. Sir Giles was in bed; anold man with a red face and white hair; his under lip dropped like thatof Gervase, though there was still a great deal of animation in hislittle bright blue eyes. He called her to come to him close to hisbedside, as if Dunning, his man, did not know exactly what his masterwas going to ask.“Has Gervase come in?” he said.“Yes, uncle.”“Is he drunk?”“Oh, no,” said Margaret eagerly, “nothing of the sort!”“That’s all right,” said the old gentleman with a sigh of satisfaction.“Now I’ll go to sleep.”Thus the whole household, though it was not to be called a sensitive ora loving household, held its watch over the poor lad who, in his patentstupidity, was its only hope.Margaret Osborne went away to the end of the corridor to her own roomwhere her little boy was sleeping. She was a few years over thirty, as Ihave said, and therefore was one of those whose day is supposed to beover. She would have said so herself from other reasons, with completegood faith. For was she not a widow, thrown back as wrecks are upon theshore, out of the storms and hurricanes of life? She might have addedthat she was cast upon a desert island, after a very brief yet sharpacquaintance with all those stirring adventures and hair-breadth escapeswhich sometimes make life a stormy voyage. She had married a soldier,and gone with him from place to place during a course of troubled years.They had been poor, and their marriage was what is called an imprudentone; but it was so much worse than that, that Captain Osborne had by nomeans intended it to be imprudent, but had remained convinced till thelast moment that Sir Giles Piercey’s niece must bring somethingsubstantial with her to the common stock. He had been warned over andover again, but he had not believed the warning; and when he foundhimself with a wife on his hands, whose utmost endowment was a verysmall allowance; enough, with economy, to dress her in the simplestmanner, but no more--while he himself had little more than his pay todepend on, the disappointment was grievous. Captain Osborne was agentleman, though not a very high-minded one, and he did his best tokeep the knowledge of this shock from his wife, and to look as if heshared that joy in life and intoxicating delight of freedom with whichMargaret, the unconsidered orphan of Greyshott, stepped forth into thefulness of existence with the man she loved. He was able to keep that upquite a long time, his despondencies and occasional irritabilities beingattributed by Margaret to anything but the real cause of them; but atthe last, in an unguarded moment, the secret slipped from him. Notanything to leave an indelible mark on her memory; not that he hadmarried her with the intention of increasing his income, which would nothave been true; but only an unintentional revelation of thedisappointment which had been in his mind from the very day of theirmarriage--the failure of a prospect upon which his thoughts were bent.“I thought I should have been able to do you more justice, Meg; but ifwe’ve grubbed on in a poor way, you must remember it’s that oldcurmudgeon of an uncle of yours that’s to blame.” She had asked what hemeant, with a startled look, and gradually had elicited the story of hisdisappointment, which sunk into her heart like a stone. Not that shemisjudged him or believed that he had married her for that only. Oh! no,no; but to think, when you have supposed your husband to be satisfiedwith your society as you with his; to find in you the fulfilment of allhis hopes of happiness as you in him; and then to discover that fromyour very marriage day he has gone forth with a disappointment, with agrudge; with an unsaid reflection, “If I had but known!”--Margaretforgot it ’mid the many events that filled her existence, forgot eventhe bitter thought that, had he known, he need not have been subjectedto those slights and scorns and forced self-denials that befall thepoor; forgot everything but love and sorrow in those last sad sceneswhich have this one compensation--that they obliterate all that is notlove from the mourner’s heart. But, nevertheless, the mark that had beenmade on her life was always there. We may have forgotten when, and how,and even by whose hand we got the wound, but the scar remains, and thesmoothness of the injured surface can never be restored.But she had her little boy, who was her estate, her endowment, herdowry, whatever else might be lacking; and who had come to be thedelight of the house in which she was received after her widowhood--oh!not unkindly--with a quite genuine compassion and friendliness, if notlove. They were not a family of delicate mind; they did not think itnecessary to spare a dependent any of those snubs or small humiliationswhich belong to her lot. They took her in frankly because she hadnowhere else to go to, with an occasional complaint of their hard fatein having to receive and support other people’s children, and anoccasional gibe at the poor relations who were always a drag upon thehead of the family. I do not say that she had not felt this, for she hada high spirit; and, perhaps, if she had been a woman educated as womenare beginning to be now, she might have felt herself capable ofachieving independence and throwing off the sore weight of charity whichis so good for those who give, but generally so hard upon those whoreceive. But after many a weary thought she had given up the hope ofthis. She had not boldness enough to venture on any great and unusualundertaking, and there were no means for a woman of earning her livingthen, except in the way of teaching (which, at all times, must be thechief standby), for which she was not capable, having had no educationherself. So that she had to accept the humiliations, to hear herselfdescribed as “my niece, you know, who has had to come back, poor thing,left without a penny. If she had not had her uncle’s house to come backto, Heaven knows what would have become of her”; and to witness thevisitor’s pressure of Lady Piercey’s hand, and admiring exclamation,“How good you are!” And it was true--they were very good. She had not amoment she could call her own, but was running their errands the wholeday. She was sick-nurse, lady’s maid, secretary, and reader, all in one.Sir Giles had moments when he remembered that to have such an invalidmaster was hard upon Dunning, and that so valuable a servant must have,now and then, an afternoon to himself; and Lady Piercey was veryconsiderate of her maid, Parsons, and insisted, as we have seen, thatshe should always get to bed by ten o’clock. But to both of these goodpeople it seemed quite natural that Meg should take the place thusvacated, and support the gouty old gentleman, and put the old lady tobed. Their own flesh and blood! like the daughter of the house! ofcourse, it was she who came in naturally to fulfil all their needs. AndMargaret never made an objection--scarcely felt one; was glad to bealways busy, always at their service; but now and then, perhaps, in anidle moment, wondered, with a smile, how they could get on without her;felt a little indignation against Dunning and Parsons, who never showedany gratitude to her for the many fatigues she spared them--and thoughtwithin herself that the story of the niece, poor thing, who had comeback without a penny, might be less frequently told.But there had come into her life a great revenge--a thing which no onehad thought of, unintentional, indeed undesired. The little boy, thebaby, whom every one had called poor little thing!--as of the mostunprotected and defenceless of God’s creation--that little boy, Osy,such a burden on the poor niece who had not a penny! had become the kingof the house! It was such a revolution as had never entered into anymind to conceive. Osy, who understood nothing about his proper place orhis position, as entirely dependent on Sir Giles’ charity, but didunderstand very well that everybody smiled upon him, delighted even inhis very naughtiness, obeyed his lightest wish, fulfilled all his littlecaprices, took his little place as prince, as if it had been the mostnatural thing in the world. From old Sir Giles, by whom he sat on hislittle stool, patting the old gentleman’s gouty foot, with the softestfeather-touch of his little hand, and babbling with all manner of babytalk profound questions that could have no answer, and shrills of littlelaughter, while even Dunning, on the other side of the old man’s chair,smiled indulgent, and declared that nothing do amuse master or take himout of himself like that child; and Lady Piercey, to whom he would run,hiding among her ample robes with full connivance on her part, when itwas time to put him to bed--while Parsons stood delighted by, allegingthat children was allays so when they was happy, and that the little ’unwas fond of her ladyship, to be sure--there was but one thought littleof Osy. He was a darling, he was, the housekeeper said, who was grim toMrs. Osborne, and resented much being obliged occasionally to take mylady’s orders from the poor niece without a penny. Gervase was the onlyone in the family who did not idolise Osy. He had liked him well enoughat first, when he mounted the little thing on his shoulder to Margaret’sterror, holding the child, who had twice his energy and spirit, with alimp arm in which there was no security. But after the time when Osy,with a fling, threw himself from his cousin’s nervous hold, and brokehis little head and plunged the house into a panic of alarm, all suchpranks had been forbidden, and Gervase took no more notice of the child,who had already begun to share the contempt of the household for him.“Why doesn’t Cousin Gervase ’list for a soldier?” Osy had asked one dayas he sat by Sir Giles. “Why should he ’list for a soldier?” asked theold gentleman; though Dunning grew pale, and Lady Piercey looked up witha sharp “Eh?” not knowing what treason was to follow. Dunning knew whathad been said on that subject in the servants’ hall, and divined thatthe child had heard and would state his authorities without hesitation.“Because----” said Osy--but then he made a pause--his mother’s eye wasupon him, and, perhaps, though he had not the least idea what she fearedand probably in childish defiance would have done that precisely had heknown, yet this glance did give him pause; and he remembered that he hadbeen told not to repeat what the servants said. The processes in achild’s mind are no less swift than those of a more calculating age.“Because,” said the boy, lingering, beginning to enjoy the suspense onall these faces, “because--it would make his back straight. Mamma saysmy back’s straight because the sergeant drilled me when I was a lickle,lickle boy.”“And the dear child is as straight as a rush, my lady,” said Parsons,who was, as so often, arranging Lady Piercey’s work. She, too, wasgrateful beyond measure to little Osy for not repeating the talk of theservants’ hall.“And what are you now, Osy,” cried Sir Giles, with a great laugh, “ifyou’re no longer a lickle, lickle boy?”“I’m the king of the castle,” said Osy, tilting at Dunning with the oldgentleman’s stick. “Bedone, you dirty rascal; let’s play at you beingthe castle, Uncle Giles, and I’ll drive off the enemy. Bedone, you dirtyrascal;--det away from my castle. I’ll be the sentry on the walls,” saidthe child, marching round and round with the stick over his shoulder fora gun, “and I’ll call out ‘Who does there?’ and ‘What’s the word’--andI’ll drive off all the enemy. But there must be a flag flying.” Hecalled it a flap, but that did not matter. “Mamma, fix a flap upon mybig tower. Here,” he cried, producing from his little pocket a crumpledrag of uncertain colour, “this hankechif will do.”“But that’s a flag of truce, Osy; are you going to give me up then?”said the old gentleman.“We’ll not have no flaps of truce,” said Osy, seizing Sir Giles’ redbandana, “for I means fightin’--and they sha’n’t come near you, but overmy body. Here! Tome on, you enemy!” Osy’s thrusts at Dunning, whoretreated outside a wider and a wider circle as the little soldier madehis rounds, amused the old gentleman beyond measure. He laughed till,which was not very difficult, the water came to his eyes.“I do believe that mite would stand up for his old uncle if there wasany occasion,” said Sir Giles, nodding his old head across at his wife,and trying in vain to recover the bandana to dry his old eyes.These were the sort of games that went on in the afternoon, especiallyin winter, when the hours were long between lunch and tea. When theweather was fine, Osy marched by Sir Giles’ garden chair, and made himthe confidant of all his wonderings. “What do the leaves fall off for,and where do they tome from when they tome again? Does gardener go tothe market to buy the new ones like mamma goes to buy clothes for me?How do the snowdrops know when it’s time to come up out of the told,told ground?” Fortunately, he had so many things to ask that he seldompaused for an answer. Sir Giles laid up these questions in his heart,and reported them to my lady. “He asked me to-day if it hurt the fieldwhen the farmers ploughed it up? I declare I never thought how strangethings were before, and the posers that little ’un asks me!” cried theold man. Lady Piercey smiled with a superior certainty, based uponMangnall’s Questions and other instructive works, that she was not soeasily posed by Osy. She had instructed him as to where tea and coffeecame from, and taught him to say, “Thank you, pretty cow,” thusaccounting for his breakfast to the inquisitive intelligence. But therewas one thing that brought a spasm to Lady Piercey’s face, especiallywhen, as now and then happened, she hid the little truant from hismother, and saved Osy from a scolding, as he nestled down amid hervoluminous skirts and lifted up a smiling, rosy little face, in greatenjoyment of the joke and the hiding place. Sometimes as she laid herhand upon his curly head with that sensation of half-malicious delightin coming between the little sinner and his natural governor, which iscommon to the grand-parent, there would come a sudden contraction to herface, and a bitter salt tear would spring to her eye. If Gervase had achild like that to be his father’s heir! Why was not that delightfulchild the child of Gervase, instead of being born to those who hadnothing to give him? It was upon Margaret, who had not a penny, thatthis immeasurable gift was bestowed. And no woman that could be themother of such a boy would ever marry Gervase! Oh! no, no--a barmaid, togive him a vulgar brat, who, perhaps----. But the thoughts of angry loveand longing are not to be put into words.Margaret went to the end of the gallery to her own room, where herchild’s soft breath was just audible as he slept. She went and looked athim in his little crib, a little head like an angel’s, upon the littlewhite pillow. But it was not only in a mother’s tender adoration thatshe stood and looked at her child. To hurt any one was not in MargaretOsborne’s heart, but there had come into it for some time back a dart ofambition, a gleam of hope: little Osy, too, was of the Piercey blood.She herself was a Piercey, much more a Piercey than Gervase, poorfellow. If an heir was wanted, who so fit as her boy? Far more fit thanold General Piercey, whom nobody knew. Oh! not for worlds, not foranything that life could give, would she harm poor Gervase, or any man.But the barmaid and her possible progeny were as odious to Margaret asto Lady Piercey: and where, where could any one find an heir like Osy,the little prince, who had conquered and taken possession of the greathouse?CHAPTER V.It has been stated by various persons afflicted with that kind oftrouble, that to be enlightened above one’s fellows is a great trial andmisery. I don’t know how that may be, but it is certainly a greattrouble to be a Softy, to have a fluid brain in which everything getsdisintegrated, and floats about in confusion, and never to be able tolay hold upon a subject distinctly either by head or tail, however muchit may concern you. This was the case of poor Gervase the morning afterhe had received that evening address from his mother in her nightcap,which was so well adapted to confuse any little wits the poor fellowhad. That his marriage might be forbidden, and his very name taken fromhim, and himself reduced to draw beer at the Seven Thorns for hisliving, instead of making a lady of Patty, and lifting her out of allsuch necessities, overwhelmed his mind altogether. If it was true, hehad better, in fact, have nothing more to say to Patty at all. A forlornsense that it might be well for her in such a case to turn to Roger, whoat least would deliver her from drawing beer, lurked in the poorfellow’s breast. Nothing would humiliate Gervase so much as the triumphof Roger, who had always been the one person in the world who pointedthe moral of his own deficiencies to the unfortunate young squire; andthere swelled in his breast a sort of dull anguish and sense ofcontrast, in which Roger’s triumphant swing of the bat and kick of thefootball mingled with his carrying off of the woman whom poor Gervaseadmired and adored, adding a double piquancy to the act of renunciationwhich he was slowly spelling out in his own dumb soul. Nobody would tryto take away that fellow’s name. He had a cottage of his own that hecould take her to, dang him! Gervase was beguiled for a moment into hisold indignant thought that such a man playing cricket all over thecounty would probably come to the workhouse in the end, and that thiswas where Patty might find herself, if she preferred the athlete tohimself; but he threw off the idea in his new evanescent impulse. Shewas too clever for that! She’d find a way to keep a man straight,whether it was a poor fellow who was not clever, or one that was toogood at every kind of diversion. I am no great believer in heredity, andthe house of Piercey was by no means distinguished for its chivalrousinstincts or tendencies; yet I am glad to think that some vagueinfluence from his ancient race had put this idea of giving up Patty, ifhe could bring only trouble and no bettering to her, into his dull andaching head. If he had been wiser, he would probably have kept away fromher in this new impulse of generosity, but he was not wise at all, hisfirst idea was to go to Patty, and tell her, and receive herorders--which no doubt she would give peremptorily--to go away from her.He never expected anything else. He was capable of giving her up, forher good, if he found himself unable to make a lady of her, in a dullsort of way, as a necessity; but he was not capable of the thought thatshe might stand by him to her own hurt. It seemed quite natural tohim--not a thing to be either blamed or doubted--that as soon as it wasproved that he could not make a lady of her, she would send him away.It was a dull morning, warm but grey, the sky, or rather the cloudshanging low, and the great stretch of the moorland country lying flatunderneath, its breadth of turf and thickets of gorse, and breaks ofsandy road and broken ground all running into one sombre, greyish,greenish, yellowish colour in the flat tones of the sunless daylight.Such a day in weariness embodied, taking the spring out of everything.The very birds in the big trees behind the Seven Thorns were affected byit and chirruped dejectedly, fathers and mothers swiftly snubbing anyyoung thing that attempted a bit of song. The seven thorns themselves,which were old trees and knocked about by time and weather and thepassing of straw-laden carts, and other drawbacks, looked shabbier andolder than ever: no place for any lovers’ meeting. Gervase had not theheart to go into the house. He sat down on the bench outside, like anytramp, and neither called to Patty, nor attempted any way of attractingher attention. She had seen him, I need not say, coming over the downs.She had eyes everywhere--not only in the back of her head, as the ostlerand the maid at the Seven Thorns said, but at the tips of her fingers,and in the handle of the broom with which she was as usual sweepingbriskly out the dust and sand of yesterday, and striking into everycorner. The weather did not affect Patty. It needed something more thana grey day to discourage her active spirits. But when she found that hersuitor did not come in, did not call her, did not even beat with hisknuckles on the rough wooden table outside, to let it be known that hewas there, surprise entered her breast; surprise and a little alarm. Shehad never let it be known by any one that she was moved by Gervase’ssuit. In her heart she had always been convinced that the Softy wouldnot be allowed to marry, and her pride would not allow her to run therisk of such a defeat. At the same time there was always the chance thather own spirit might carry him through, and the prospect was tooglorious to be altogether thrown away; so that when Patty became awarethat he was sitting there outside, with not heart enough to say Boh! toa goose--alarm stole over her, and to contemplate the possible failureof all these hopes, was more than she could calmly bear. She stood stillfor a minute or two listening, with her head a little on one side, andall her faculties concentrated upon the sounds from the door: but heardnothing except the aimless scrape of his foot against the sandy pebblesoutside. Finally she went out, and stood on the threshold, her broomstill in her hand.“Oh! so it is you, Mr. Gervase! I couldn’t think who it could be thatstuck there without a word to nobody. You’ve got a headache, as I saidyou would.”“No--I’ve got no headache. If I’ve anything, it’s here,” said poorGervase, laying his hand on what he believed to be his heart.“Lord, your stomach, then!” said Patty with a laugh--“but folks don’tsay that to a lady; though I dare to say it’s very true, for beer is areal heavy thing, whatever you men may say.”“I am not thinking of beer,” said Gervase. “I wish there was nothingmore than that, Patty, between you and me.”“Between you and me!” she cried with a twirl of her broom along thestep, “there’s nothing between you and me. There’s a deal to be donefirst, Mr. Gervase, before any man shall say as there’s somethingbetween him and Miss Hewitt of the Seven Thorns; and if you don’t knowthat, you’re the only man in the parish as doesn’t. Is there anything asI can do for you? for I’ve got my work, and I can’t stand idling here.”“Oh, Patty, don’t turn like that at the first word! As if I wasn’t downenough! You told me last night to give it up for your sake, and I meantto; and now you come and tempt me with it! If I must have neither mybeer nor you, what is to become of me?” poor Gervase cried.Patty felt that things were becoming serious. She was conscious of allthe pathos of this cry. She leant the broom in a corner, and coming downthe steps, approached the disconsolate young man outside. “Whatever’s todo, Mr. Gervase?” she said.“Patty, I’ll have to give you up!” said the poor fellow, with his headupon his hand, and something very like a sob bursting from his breast.“Give me up? You’ve never had me, so you can’t give me up,” cried proudPatty. She was, however, more interested by this than by other moreflattering methods of wooing. She laughed fiercely. “Sir Giles and mylady won’t hear of it? No, of course they won’t! And this is my finegentleman that thought nothing in the world as good as me! I told youyou’d give in at the first word!” She was very angry, though she hadnever accepted poor Gervase’s protestations. He raised his headpiteously, and the sight of her, flaming, sparkling, enveloping him in asort of fiery contempt and fury, roused the little spark ofgentlemanhood that was in Gervase’s breast.“If I give in,” he said, “it is because of you, Patty. I’ll not marryyou--not if you were ready this moment--to be the wife of a man withouta penny that would have to draw beer for his living. I wouldn’t; no, Iwouldn’t--unless I was to make you a lady. I wanted--to make a lady ofyou, Patty!”And he wept; the Softy, the poor, silly fellow! Patty had something inher, though she was the veriest little egotist and as hard as the nethermillstone, which vibrated in spite of her at this touch. She said,“Lord, bless the man! What nonsense is he talking? Draw beer for hisliving! Tell me now, Mr. Gervase, there’s a dear, what is’t you mean.”And then poor Gervase poured out his heart: how he had been threatenedwith the Lord Chancellor and even with the Queen; how they could takenot only every penny but his very name from him, and so make him bringshame upon the girl he loved instead of honour and glory as he hadhoped. And how, in these circumstances, he would have to give her up.Better, though it might kill him, that she should marry a man who couldkeep her up in every thing than one who would be thrown upon her to makehis living drawing beer.Patty listened patiently, and cross-examined acutely to get to thebottom of this mystery. She was a little overawed to hear of the LordChancellor, whose prerogatives she could not limit, and who might beable to do something terrible; but gradually her good sense surmountedeven the terrors of that mysterious power. “They can’t take your namefrom you,” she said; “it’s nonsense; not a bit. Your name? Why, you wereborn to it. It’s not like the estate. Of course your name’s yours, andnobody can’t take it away.”“Not?” said Gervase, looking up beseechingly into her eyes.“Not a bit. I, for one, don’t believe it. Nor the property either! I,for one, don’t believe it. They’ve neither chick nor child but you.What! give it away to a dreadful old man, a cousin, and you there,their own child! No, Mr. Gervase, I don’t believe a word of it. Theywanted to frighten you bad; and so they have done, and that’s all.”“They sha’n’t frighten me,” said Gervase, lifting his pale cheek andsetting his hat on with a defiant look, “not if you’ll stand by me,Patty.”“How am I to stand by you,” cried the coquette with a laugh, “if you’rea-going to give me up?”“It was only for your sake, Patty,” he said. “I’d marry you to-day if Icould, you know. That’s what I should like--just to marry you straightoff this very day.” He got up and came close to her, almost animated inthe fervour of his passion. His dull eyes lighted up, a little colourcame to his face. If he could only be made always to look like that, itwould be something like! was the swift thought that passed through hermind. She kept him off, retreating a step, and raising both her hands.“Stand where you are, Mr. Gervase! You say so, I know; but I don’t seeas you do anything to prove it, for all your fine words.”A look of distress, the puzzled distress habitual to it, came over poorGervase’s face. His under lip dropped once more, “What can I do?” hecried; “if I knew, I’d do it fast enough. Patty, don’t it all stand withyou?”“I never heard yet,” cried Patty, “that it was the lady who took thesteps; everybody knows there’s steps that have to be took.”“What steps, what steps, Patty?” he cried, with a feeble glance at hisown feet, and the trace of them on the sandy road. Then a gleam of shameand confusion came over the poor fellow’s face. He knew the steps to betaken could not be like that, and paused eager, anxious, with his mouthopen, waiting for his instructions--like a faithful dog ready to startafter any stick or stone.“Oh, you can’t expect me to be the one to tell you,” cried Patty,turning away as if to go back to the house; “the lady isn’t the one tothink of all that.”“Patty! I’m ready, ready to do anything! but how am I to know all ofmyself? I never had anything of the sort to do.”“I hope not,” said Patty, with a laugh, “or else you wouldn’t be for me,Mr. Gervase, not if you were a duke--if you had been married before.”“I--married before! Patty, only tell me what to do!” He looked exactlylike Dash, waiting for somebody to throw a stone for him, but not soclever as Dash, alas! with that forlorn look of incapacity in his face,and the wish which was not father to any thought.“Well, if you’re so pressing, a clergyman has the most to do with it.”“I’ll go off to the rector directly.” He was like Dash now, when a feinthad been made of throwing the stone: off on the moment--yet with a sensethat all was not well.“Oh! stop, you----!” Whatever the noun was, Patty managed to swallow it.“Come back,” she cried, as she might have cried to Dash. “Don’t you see?The rector; he’s the last man in the world.”“Why?” cried Gervase. “He knows me, and you, and everything.”“He knows--a deal too much,” said Patty; “he’d go and tell it all at theHall, and make them send for the Lord Chancellor, or whatever it is.”Poor Gervase trembled a little. “Couldn’t we run away, Patty, you and metogether?” he said humbly; “I know them that have done that.”“And have all the parish say I’m not married at all, and be treated likea---- wherever I showed my head. No, thank you, Mr. Gervase Piercey. Idon’t think enough of you for that.”“You would think enough of Roger for that,” cried poor Gervase, stung tothe heart.“Roger!” she cried, spinning round upon him with a flush on her face.“Roger would have had the banns up long before this, if I had ever saidas much to him.”“The banns!” cried Gervase. “Ah, now I know! that’s the clerk!” Thestone was thrown at last. “They’ll be up,” he said, waving his hand toher as he looked back, “before you know where you are!”It was all that Patty could do to stop him, to bring him back before hewas out of hearing. Dash never rushed more determinedly after his stone.“Mr. Gervase,” she shouted, “Mr. Piercey; sir! Hi! here! Come back, comeback! Oh, come back, I tell you!” stamping her foot upon the ground.He returned at last, very like the dog still, humbled, his head fallen,and discomfiture showing in the very attitude of his limp limbs.“Is that not right either?” he said.“The clerk would be up at the Hall sooner than the rector; the rectorwould understand a little bit, but the clerk not at all. Don’t you see,Mr. Gervase, if it is to be----”“It shall be, Patty.”“It must be in another parish, not here at all; and then you’d have togo to stay there for a fortnight.”“Go to stay there for a fortnight!” Dismay was in the young man’s face.“How could I do that, Patty, with never having any money, and neverallowed to sleep a night from home?”“Well, for that matter,” she said, “how are you to marry anybody ifthings are to go on so?”He made no reply, but looked at her with a miserable countenance, withhis under lip dropped, his mouth open, and lack-lustre eyes.And here Patty made a pause, looking at her lover, or rather gazing inthe face of fate, and hesitating for one dread, all-important moment:she was not without a tenderness for him, the poor creature who adoredher like Dash; but that was neither here nor there. While she looked athim there rose between him and her a vision of a very different face,strong and sure, that would never pause to be told what to do, thatwould perhaps master her as she mastered him. Ah! but then there was apoor cottage on one side, with a wife whose husband would be little athome, in too much request for her happiness; and on the other there wasthe Hall and the chance of being my lady. She looked in the face offate, and seized it boldly, as her manner was.“Stop a bit,” she said; “there’s another way.”“What is it, what is it, Patty?”“But it wants money; it costs a bit of money--a person has to go toLondon to get it.”“Oh, Patty, Patty, haven’t I told you----”“Stop!” she said; “I’m going to think it over; perhaps it can be done,after all, if you’ll do what I tell you. Don’t come near the SevenThorns to-night; stay at home and be very good to the old folks; sayyou’d like to see London and a little life, and you’re tired of here.”“But that would be a lie!”“Oh, you softhead, if you’re going to stick at that! Perhaps you don’twant me at all, Mr. Gervase. Give me up; it would be far the best thingfor you, far the best thing for you! and then there’s nothing more to besaid.”“Oh, Patty!” cried the poor fellow; “oh, Patty! when you know I’d giveup my life for you.”“Then do as I say, and mind everything I say, and I’ll see if it can’tbe done.”CHAPTER VI.Gervase went home as she had told him, not bounding after the stone likea dog who has got its heart’s desire, but steadily, a little heavily,somewhat disappointed, yet full of expectation, and always faithful.Something was going to be done for him that would result in Patty’sstanding by him for ever, and helping him to all he wanted. He did notknow what it was; he was by no means sure that he would understand whatit was were he told; but she did, and that was enough. It was going tobe done for him, while he had no trouble and would only reap theresults. That was how it was going to be all the rest of the time. Pattywould take the responsibility. She would face everything for him. Shewould stand between him and his mother’s jibes and his father’soccasional roar of passion. Gervase was dimly sensible that his peoplewere ashamed of him, that they thought him of little account. But Pattydid not feel like that. She, too, jibed at him, it is true; but then shejibed at everybody, even Roger. It was different, and she would let noone else jibe. She would take all the responsibility; with her besidehim, standing by him, or perhaps in front of him, standing between himand all that was disagreeable, he should escape all the ills of life. Heshould not be afraid of any one any more. He went back to the halldetermined to carry out his orders. For her sake he would make a martyrof himself all that evening; he would sit with the old folks and do hisbest to please them. He would talk about London and how he wished to seeit. He would say he was tired of the country--even that, since Pattytold him to do so. To be sure, if there was no Patty, he would be tiredof it; if the Hall meant the country, yes, indeed, he was tired enoughof that. He went home not in the least knowing what to do with himself;but faithful, faithful to his orders. Dash, when commanded to give upthe wild delights of a run and watch a coat, or a stick, did itresignedly with noble patience, and so did Gervase now: he had, so tospeak, to watch Patty’s coat while she went and did the work; it is thenatural division of labour when one of two is the faithful dog ratherthan the man.He began, three or four times, as he went along, that game with thewhite pebbles against the brown, and then remembered that it was silly,and pulled himself up. He would not like Patty to know that he had ahabit of doing that. He was aware, instinctively, that it would seemvery silly to her. Three, four, and five; and a great big one thatought to count three at least for the right hand man. No; he wouldn’t doit; it was silly; it was like a child, not a man. What, he wondered, wasshe going to do? Not go to the rector, because she had herself objectedto that. Another way--he wondered what other way there could be--thatdispensed with both parson and clerk? But that, thank Heaven, wasPatty’s affair, and she had promised that she would do it. Seven brownones in a row; such luck for the left-hand man! But no, no; he would notpay any attention to that. Patty would think him a fool for his pains.What was she doing--she that knew exactly what it was best to do? What awoman she was, up to everything; seeing with one look of her eye what henever would have found out, that it was not the right thing to speak tothe rector, nor to the clerk, who was still worse than the rector. Howmuch better it was that it should be all in her hands! How was a man toknow, who had never been married himself, who knew nothing about suchthings, how to put up banns? What were banns? He had heard people askedin church, but he was not sure about the other name. Was it something,perhaps, to hang up like a picture? These thoughts did not pass throughGervase’s mind in so many words, but floated after each other vaguely,swimming in a dumb sort of consciousness. He had, perhaps, never had somany all turning round and crossing each other before. Generally it wasonly the pebbles he thought of as he walked unless when it was Patty. Itgave him a strange sort of bewildering sense of life to feel how manythings he was thinking of--such a crowd of different things.In the beech avenue, going up and down in his chair, pushed by Dunning,and with Osy capering upon a stick before him, Gervase came upon hisfather taking his morning “turn.” He remembered what Patty said aboutbeing agreeable to the old folks, and he also had a certain pleasure inwheeling his father’s chair. So he stopped and pushed the servant away.“You go and take a rest, Dunning. I’ll take Sir Giles along,” he said.“You mustn’t play any tricks, Mr. Gervase,” said the man, resisting alittle. “What tricks should I play? I can take care of my father as wellas any one, I hope,” cried Gervase, taking with energy the back of thechair. It went along a little more quickly perhaps, but Sir Giles didnot mind that. “Young legs go faster than ours, Dunning,” he said to hisservant; “but stand you by, old man, in case Mr. Gervase gets tired.”“Oh, I’ll stand by. I’ll not leave that Softy in charge of my master,”Dunning said to himself. “Oh, I’ll not get tired, father,” said Gervasealoud. This was quite a delightful way of uniting obedience to Patty’scommands with pleasure to himself. “I’ll take you all round the grounds,father. Ain’t you tired of this beastly little bit of an avenue? I’lltake you faster, as fast as the carriage if you like.” “No, my boy,this’ll do,” said Sir Giles; “fair and softly goes the furthest.”Dunning came on behind shaking his head.“You tan’t ride so fast as me, Uncle Giles,” cried little Osy, prancingupon his wooden steed.“Can’t he, though, you little beggar. He’d soon run you out of breath,if I was to put on steam!”“Oh, tome on, tome on!” cried Osy, flourishing his whip; and off Gervasetore, sweeping the chair along, with Dunning after him panting andexclaiming, and Sir Giles laughing, but shaking with the wild progressof the vehicle which usually went so quietly. The old gentleman ratherliked it than otherwise, though when Gervase stopped with a sudden jerkand jar, he was thrown back upon his pillows, and seized with a fit ofcoughing. “You see you cannot do everything, little ’un; there’s somethat can beat you,” cried Gervase, waving his long arms, and drawing uphis sleeves. Osy had been thrown quite behind, and came up panting, hislittle countenance flushed, and his little legs twisting as he ran, thechild no longer making any pretence to be a prancing steed. “Are yougame for another run?”“Yes, I’m dame,” cried little Osy, making a valorous struggle for hisbreath.“No, no, that’s enough,” cried Sir Giles, coughing and laughing, “that’senough, Gervase. No harm done, Dunning--you need not come puffing like asteam engine; but halt, Gervase, no more, no more.”“Uncle Giles, I’m dame, tome on; Uncle Giles, I’m dame,” shouted Osyflourishing his little cap.This scene was seen from my lady’s chamber with extremely mingledfeelings. Lady Piercey sat in the recess of the window, where, in theevening, that querulous light had burned, waiting till Gervase camehome. She had an old-fashioned embroidery frame fixed there, and workedat it for half an hour occasionally, with Margaret Osborne in attendanceto thread her needles. Parsons had long since declared that her eyeswere not equal to it, but with Mrs. Osborne there could be no suchexcuse. Lady Piercey had forgotten all about her work in watching.“There is my boy Gervase wheeling his father,” she said; “look out, lookout, Meg. Whatever you may say, that boy is full of feeling. Look! Hehas taken it out of Dunning’s hands. See how pleased your uncle is; andlittle Osy acting outrider, bless him. Oh!” cried Lady Piercey with ashriek. Her terror made her speechless. She fell back in her chair withpassionate gesticulations, grasped Margaret, and pulled her to thewindow, then thrust her away, pointing to the door. “Go! go!” she criedwith a great effort, in a choked voice--which Parsons heard, and cameflying from the next room.“It’s nothing, aunt; see, they’ve stopped. It’s all right, Uncle Gilesis laughing.”“Go! go!” cried the old lady, pointing passionately to the door.“Go, for goodness gracious sake, Mrs. Osborne. My lady will have a fit.”“There is nothing--absolutely nothing, aunt. They’ve stopped. Dunninghas taken his place again; there’s no need for interfering. Ah!”Margaret gave just such a cry as Lady Piercey had done, and flingingdown her little sheaf of silks upon the frame, turned and flew from theroom, leaving the old lady and her maid exchanging glances ofconsternation. And yet the cause of Mrs. Osborne’s sudden change ofopinion was not far to seek; it was that Gervase had seized little Osyand swung him up to his shoulder, where the child sat very red anduneasy, but too proud to acknowledge that he was afraid.“Put down my child this moment!” cried Margaret, descending like athunderbolt in the midst of the group.“He’s as right as a trivet. I’m going to give him a ride. I haven’tgiven him a ride for a long time. Hi! Osy, ain’t you as right as atrivet, and got a good seat?”“Yes, tousin Gervase,” said the boy with a quaver in his voice, butholding his head high.“Put him down this moment!” cried Margaret, stamping her foot andseizing Gervase by the arm.“I’ll put him down when he’s had his ride. Now, old Dunning, here’s forit. We’ll race you for a sovereign to the gate. Sit tight, Osy, or yourhorse will throw you--he’s as wild as all the wild horses that ever weremade.”“Div me my whip first,” cried the child. He was elated though he wasafraid. “And I won’t ride you if you haven’t a bit in your mouff.” Oncemore the little grimy pocket-handkerchief was brought into service.“Here’s the bit, and I’m holding you in hand. Now, trot!”Margaret stood like a ghost, while the wild pair darted along theavenue, Gervase prancing with the most violent motion, little Osysitting very tight, holding on to his handkerchief with the tightness ofdesperation, his cheeks blazing and throbbing with the tumultuous colourof courage, excitement, and fright. They are things which consist witheach other. The child was afraid of nothing, but very conscious that hehad once before been thrown from Gervase’s shoulder, and that theprospect was not a pleasant one. As for the spectators, Sir Giles in hischair and his wife at the window, they were in a ferment of mingledfeeling, afraid for their pet, but excited by this new development onthe part of their son. “Mr. Gervase is really taking great care,” gaspedLady Piercey to her maid. “Don’t you see? He’s got the child quitetight--not like that other time; Master Osy is quite enjoying it.”“Oh yes, my lady,” said Parsons, doubtfully; “he’s got such a spirit.”“And his cousin is so kind, so kind. There’s nobody,” said the oldlady, with a sob and a gasp, “so good to children as my Gervase. There!thank Heaven, he’s put him down. Miss Meg--I mean Mrs. Osborne is makinga ridiculous fuss about it,” said Lady Piercey, now running all herwords into one in the relief of her feelings, “as if there was any fearof the child!”Little Osy had swung down through the air with a sinking whirl as if hehad shot Niagara, but once on firm ground, being really none the worse,tingled to his fingers’ ends with pride and triumph. He gave a smack ofhis little whip with his right hand, while with the other he clutchedhis mother’s dress, trembling and glowing. “Dood-bye, dood horse;I’ll--I’ll wide you again another time,” he shouted, with a slightquaver in his voice.Sir Giles was half-weeping, half-laughing, in the excitement of his ageand weakness. Now that the child was safe, he, too, was delighted andproud. “Good’un to go, ain’t he, Osy?” he cried. “But I say, lad, yououghtn’t to caper like that; he’s a deal too fresh, Dunning, eh? wantsto have it taken out of him.”“Yes, Sir Giles,” said Dunning. (“And I’d just like to take it out ofhim with a cart whip,” he murmured, between his closed teeth.)Lady Piercey was weeping a little, too, at her window, calming down fromher excitement. “How strong he is, bless him, and well-made when heholds himself straight; and wouldn’t harm the child not for the world,or any one that trusts him. Oh, Parsons, what a joyful family we’d be ifMaster Osy had been my son’s boy!”“Bless you, my lady, he’s too young to have a boy as big as that.”“So he is, the dear. If I could live to see him with an heir, Parsons!”“And why not, my lady? You’re not to call old, and with proper care andtaking your medicines regular--one of these days he’ll be bringing homesome nice young lady.” (“Some poor creature as will be forced to take’im, or else Patty of the Seven Thorns,” was Parsons’ comment withinherself.)“And then that poor little darling!” said Lady Piercey, regretfully.“But,” she added with a firmer tone, “Meg spoils the boy to such adegree that he’ll be ruined before he’s a man. Look at her petting himas if he’d been in any danger; but she never had an ounce of sense. Getme my things, Parsons; I’ll go down and sit in the air a bit and talk tomy boy.”Gervase had fallen out of his unusual liveliness before his mothersucceeded in reaching the beech avenue, but he came forward at her call,and permitted her to take his arm. “I like to see you in spirits,” theold lady said, “but you mustn’t shake about your father like that.Dunning’s safest for an old man.”“I’ll drive you out in the phaeton, mother, if you like, thisafternoon.”“No, my dear; I feel safest in the big carriage with the cobs, and oldAndrews; but it’s a pleasure to see you in such spirits, Gervase; you’relike my own old boy.”“You see,” said Gervase, with his imbecile, good-humoured smile, “I’vepromised to do all I can to please you at home.”“Ah!” cried the old lady, “and who might it be that made you promisethat? and why?”Gervase broke into a laugh. “Wouldn’t you just like to know?” he said.CHAPTER VII.“Osy,” said Mrs. Osborne, “you mustn’t let cousin Gervase get hold ofyou like that again.”“He’s a dood horse,” said the little boy, “when I sit tight. I have tosit vewey tight; but next time I’ll get on him’s both shoulders, andhold him like a real horse. He’s dot a too narrow back, and too far upfrom the ground.”“But listen to me, Osy. It makes me too frightened. You mustn’t ride himagain.”“I’ll not wide him if I can help it,” said Osy, reddening with mingleddaring and terror, “but he takes me up before I can det far enough off,and I tan’t run away, mamma.”“But you must run away, Osy, when I tell you.”The child looked up at her doubtfully. “It was you that told megemplemens don’t run away.”“Not before an enemy, or that,” said Margaret, taking refuge in thevague, “but when it’s only for fun, Osy.”“Fun isn’t never serous, is it, mamma?”“It would be very serious if you fell from that fo----, from CousinGervase’s shoulder, Osy. Go out for a walk this afternoon, dear, withnurse.”“I don’t like nurse. I like Uncle Giles best. And I’m the outwider,telling all the people he’s toming.”“You see Uncle Giles has got something else to do.”Gervase was still in the foreground of the picture, carrying out his_consigne_. The servant had brought out upon the terrace at the otherside of the house a box containing a game of which, in former days, SirGiles had been fond. It was Gervase who had proposed this diversionto-day. “I’ll play father a game at that spinner thing,” he had said,after the large heavy luncheon, which was Sir Giles’ dinner. “I’d likethat, lad,” the old man cried with delight. It was a beautifulafternoon, and nothing could be more charming than the shady terrace onthe east side of the house which in these hot July days was always cool.The sunshine played on the roof of the tall house, and fell full on theturf and the shrubs, and the flower garden at the south corner, but onthe terrace all was grateful shade. The game was brought out, and manyexperiments were made to see at what angle Sir Giles could best throwthe ball with which it was played--an experiment in which Dunning tookmore or less interest, seeing it saved him another weary promenadethrough the grounds, pushing his master’s chair. The carriage waswaiting round the corner, and Lady Piercey came sailing downstairs withParsons behind her carrying a large cloak. “Meg! do you know I’m readyto go out?” cried Lady Piercey, in the tone of that king who had oncealmost been made to wait. “May I bring Osy, aunt?” cried Margaret. “No,”was the peremptory answer. “I’ll go without you if you don’t be quick.”“And I don’t want to go, mover,” said Osy. “I’m doing to play with UncleGiles.”“Come along, little duffer,” cried Gervase; “I’ll give you another ridewhen we’ve done playing.”“Meg, come this moment!” cried Lady Piercey; and Margaret, with agonisedvisions, was compelled to go. Bitter is the bread of those who have torun up and down another man’s stairs, and be as the dogs under histable. “Oh!” Margaret Osborne said to herself, “if I had but thesmallest cottage of my own! If I could but take in needlework or clearstarching, and work for my boy!” Perhaps the time might come when thatprayer should be fulfilled, and when it would not seem so sweet as shethought.Lady Piercey took her usual drive in a long round through the familiarroads which she had traversed almost every day for the last thirtyyears. She knew not only every village, but every cottage in everyvillage, and every tree, and every clump of wild honeysuckle or clematisflaunting high upon the tops of the hedges. By dint of long use, she hadcome to make that frequent, almost daily, progress without seeinganything, refreshed, it is to be supposed, by the sweep of the wideatmosphere and all the little breezes that woke and breathed about heras she went over long miles and miles of green country, all monotonouslyfamiliar and awakening no sensation in her accustomed breast. Shethought of her own affairs as she made these daily rounds, which many apoorer woman envied the old lady, thinking how pleasant it would be tochange with her, and see the world from the luxurious point of vantageof a landau with a pair of good horses, and a fat coachman and agilefootman on the box. But Lady Piercey thought of none of theseadvantages, nor of the beautiful country, nor the good air, but only ofher own cares, which filled up all the foreground of her life, as theydo with most of us. After a while, being forced by the concatenation ofcircumstances, she began to discuss these cares with Margaret, which washer custom when Parsons, who knew them all as well as her ladyship, wasout of the way. Mrs. Osborne was made fully aware that it was becausethere was no one else near, that she was made the confidant of heraunt’s troubles; but she listened, nevertheless, very dutifully, thoughto-day with a somewhat distracted mind, thinking of her child, andseeing an awful vision before her of Osy tossed from Gervase’s shoulderand lying stunned on the ground, with nobody but Dunning and Sir Gilesto look after him. This made her perhaps less attentive than usual toall Lady Piercey’s theories as to what would be the making of Gervase,and save him from all difficulties and dangers. The old lady was notdeceived in respect to her son; she was very clear-sighted, although ina moment of excitement, as on that morning, she might be ready to credithim with ideal virtues; on ordinary occasions nothing could be moreclear than her estimate, or more gloomy than her forecast, of what hisfuture might be.“I am resolved on one thing,” said Lady Piercey, “that we must marry himby hook or crook. I hate the French: they’re a set of fools, good fornothing but dancing and singing and making a row in the world; but Iapprove their way in marrying. They would just look out a suitableperson, money enough, and all that, and he’d have to marry her whetherhe liked it or not. Are you listening, Meg? If your uncle had done thatwith you, now, what a much better thing for you than pleasing your fancyas you did and grieving your heart!”“I’m not worth discussing, aunt, and all that’s over and gone long ago.”“That’s true enough; but you’re an example, and if I think proper, I’lluse it. I dare say Captain Osborne thought you had a nice bit of moneywhen he first began to think of you, and was a disappointed man when heknew----”“Aunt, I cannot have my affairs discussed.”“You shall have just what I please and nothing else,” said the grim oldlady. “I have had enough of trouble about you to have a right to saywhat I please. And so I shall do, whatever you may say. A deal better itwould have been for you if we had just married you, as I always wished,to a sensible man with a decent income, who never would have left you tocome back upon your family, as you have had to do. That’s a heavy priceto pay, my dear, for the cut of a man’s moustache. And I’d just like tomanage the same for my own boy, who is naturally much more to me thanyou. But then there’s the girl to take into account; girls are so muchindulged nowadays, they take all kinds of whimseys into their heads. NowI should say, from my point of view, that Gervase would make anexcellent husband; if she was sensible, and knew how to manage, shemight turn him round her little finger. What do you say? Oh, I know youare never likely to think of anything to the advantage of my boy.”“I think my cousin Gervase has a great many good qualities, aunt;whether you would be doing right in making him marry, is anothermatter.”“Oh, you think so! it would be better to leave him unmarried, and thenwhen we die Osy would have the chance? For all so clever as you are,Meg, I can see through you there. But Osy has no chance, as you ought toknow. There’s the General, and his son, Gerald--a new name in thefamily, as if the Gileses and the Gervases were not good enough for ayounger branch! If it was Osy, bless the child, I don’t know that Ishould mind so much,” the old lady said in a softened tone, with a tearsuddenly starting in the corner of her eye.“Thank you for thinking that,” said Margaret, subdued. “I know very wellit could never be Osy.”“But there might be another Osy,” said Lady Piercey, putting away thattear with a surreptitious finger. “There never was a brighter man thanyour uncle, and I’m no fool; and yet you see Gervase---- What’s tohinder Gervase from having a boy like his father if the mother of it wasgood for anything? A girl, if she had any sense, might see that. What’sone person in a family? The family goes on and swamps the individual.You may be surprised at me using such words; but I’ve thought a dealabout it--a great deal about it, Meg. A good girl of a good race, thatis what he wants; and, goodness gracious, if she only knew how to setabout it, what an easy time she might have!”To this, Margaret, being probably of another opinion, made no reply; andLady Piercey, after an expectant and indignant pause, burst forth--“Youdon’t think so, I suppose? You think the only thing he’s likely to get,or that is fit for him, is this minx at the Seven Thorns?”“I never thought so,” cried Margaret, “nor believed in that atall--never for a moment.”“That shows how much you know,” said the old lady, with a snort ofanger. “I believe in it, if you don’t. Who is he staying at home to-dayand trying to please, the booby! that hadn’t sense enough to keep thatquiet? Don’t you see he’s under orders from her? Ah, she knows what’swhat, you may be sure. She sees all the ways of it, and just how tomanage him. The like of you will not take the trouble to find out, butthat sort of minx knows by nature. Oh, she has formed all her plans, youmay be sure! She knows exactly how she is going to do it and baffle allof us; but I shall put a spoke in my lady’s wheel. My lady!” cried LadyPiercey, with the irritation of one who feels her own dearest rightsmenaced; “she is calculating already how soon she’ll get my name andmake me the dowager! I know it as well as if I saw into her; but she isgoing a bit too fast, and you’ll see that I’ll put a spoke in her wheel!John! you can turn back now, and drive to the place I told you of. Iwant to ask about some poultry at that little inn. You know the name ofit.”“The Seven Thorns, my lady?” said John, turning round on the box, withhis hand at his hat, and his face red with suppressed laughter, madeterrible by fear of his mistress--as if he and the coachman had not beenperfectly well aware, when the order was given, what kind of wildfowlwas that pretended poultry which took Lady Piercey to the Seven Thorns!“So it is; that was the name,” said the old lady. “You can take thefirst turning, and get there as quick as possible. You’ll just see how Ishall settle her,” she added, nodding her head as soon as the man’s backwas turned.“Do you mean to see the girl, aunt?” cried Margaret, in surprise andalarm.“What’s so wonderful in that? Of course I mean to see her. I shall lether know that I understand all her little plans, and mean to put a stopto them. She is not to have everything her own way.”“But, aunt, do you think a girl of that kind will pay anyattention?--don’t you think that perhaps it will do more harm than----”“I know that you have always a fine opinion of your own people, MegPiercey! and of me especially, that am only your aunt by marriage. Youthink there’s nothing I can do that isn’t absurd--but I thinkdifferently myself, and you shall just see. Attention? Of course shewill pay attention. I know these sort of people; they believe what youtell them in a way you wouldn’t do: they know no better. They’re farcleverer than you in some things, but in others they’ll believe justwhat you please to tell them,” said Lady Piercey, with a fierce toss ofher head, “if you speak strong enough; and I promise you I sha’n’t failin that!”The carriage swept along with an added impulse of curiosity andexpectation which seemed to thrill through from the men on the box, whoformed an impatient and excited gallery, eager to see what was going tohappen, to the calm, respectable horses, indifferent to such mere humancommotions, who probably were not aware why they were themselves made tostep out so much more briskly. The carriage reached the Seven Thorns atan hour in the afternoon which was unusually quiet, and which had beenselected by Patty on that account for an expedition which she had tomake. She was coming out of her own door, when the two cobs drew up withthat little flourish which is essential to every arrival, even at ahumble house like that of the Seven Thorns, and stood there for a momenttransfixed, with a sudden leap of excitement in all her pulses at thesight of the heavy old landau, which she, of course, knew as well as sheknew any cart in the village. Was it possible that it was going to stop?It was going to stop! She stood on her own threshold almost paralysed,stupefied--though at the same time tingling with excitement and energyand wonder. My lady in her carriage, the great lady of the district! thepotentate whom Patty of the Seven Thorns, audacious, meant to succeed,if not to supersede! The effect upon her for the first moment was tomake her knees tremble, and her strength fail; for the next, to braceher up to a boldness unknown to her, though she had never before beentimid at any time.“If you please, my lady,” said John, obsequious, yet with his eyesdancing with excitement and curiosity, at the carriage door, “that isMiss Hewitt of the Seven Thorns on the doorstep, if it is her yourladyship wants. Shall I say your ladyship wishes to----”“Look here! you’ve got to go off to the post-office at once to get mesome stamps. I’ll manage the rest for myself,” said Lady Piercey,thrusting two half-crowns into the man’s hand. Poor John! with the dramathus cut short at its most exciting moment! She waited till he hadturned his back, and then she waved her hand to Patty, still standingthunderstricken on the threshold. “Hi!--here!” cried Lady Piercey, whodid not err in her communications with the country people round her onthe civil side.If it had not been for overpowering excitement, curiosity, and thedesire for warfare, which is native to the human breast, Patty wouldhave stood upon her dignity, disregarded this peremptory call, andmarched away. She almost tried to do so, feeling more or less what animmense advantage it would have given her, but her instinct was toostrong--a double and complicated instinct which moved her as if she hadnot been at all a free agent: first, the impulse to obey my lady, whichwas a thing that might have been overcome, but second, the impulse tofight my lady, which was much less easy to master, and, last of all, anoverpowering, dizzying, uncontrollable curiosity to know what she couldhave to say. She stepped down from her own door deliberately, however,and with all the elegance and eloquence she could put into hermovements, and went slowly forward to the carriage door. She was in herbest dress, which was not, perhaps, so becoming to Patty as thehomelier attire, which was more perfect of its kind than the second-rateyoung ladyhood of her Sunday frock. Her hat was very smart with flowersand bows of velvet, which happened to be the fashion of the time, andshe carried a parasol covered with lace, and wore a pair of lightgloves, which were not in harmony with the colour of her dress--neither,indeed, were Lady Piercey’s own gloves in harmony with her apparel, butthat was a different matter. The old lady’s keen glance took in everyarticle of Patty’s cheap wardrobe, with a comment on the way thesecreatures dress! as she came forward with foolish deliberation, as if toallow herself time to be examined from head to foot.“You are Patty, that used to come out so well in the examinations,” LadyPiercey said, with a breathlessness which showed what excitement existedon her side.“I am Patience Hewitt, my lady, if that is what you’re pleased to ask.”Margaret sat looking on trembling at these two belligerents: her aunt,who overbore her, Margaret, without any trouble silenced all herarguments and shut her mouth; and this girl of the village andpublic-house, the Sunday-school child whom she remembered, the pet ofthe rector, the clever little monitor and ringleader--Patty, of theSeven Thorns, something between a housemaid and a barmaid, and LadyPiercey of Greyshott! The looker-on, acknowledging herself inferior toboth of them, felt that they were not badly matched.“Ah!” said Lady Piercey, “yes, that’s what I asked. You’re RobertHewitt’s daughter, I suppose, who keeps the public-house on ourproperty?”“Begging your pardon, my lady, the old inn of the Seven Thorns is myfather’s property, and has been his and his family’s for I don’t knowhow many hundred years.”“Oh!” cried Lady Piercey with a stare, “you speak up very bold, youngwoman; yet you’ve been bred up decently, I suppose, and taught how youought to conduct yourself in that condition in which God has placedyou.”“If you wish to know about my character, my lady, the rector will giveit you; though I don’t know why you should trouble about it, seeing as Iam not likely to wish a place under your ladyship, or under anybody, forthat matter.”“No,” cried Lady Piercey, exasperated into active hostilities; “youwould like to climb up over our heads, that’s what you would like todo.”Patty replied to the excited stare with a look of candid surprise. “Howcould I climb over anybody’s head, I wonder? me that manages everythingfor father, and keeps house at the Seven Thorns?”“You look very mild and very fine,” said Lady Piercey, leaning over theside of the carriage, and emphasising her words with look and gesture,“but I’ve come here expressly to let you understand that I knoweverything, and that what you’re aiming at sha’n’t be! Don’t look at meas if you couldn’t divine what I was speaking of! I know every one ofyour plots and plans--every one! and if you think that you, a bit of agirl in a public-house, can get the better of Sir Giles and me, thechief people in the county, I can tell you you’re very far mistaken.”Lady Piercey leant over the side of the carriage and spoke in a lowvoice, which was much more impressive than if she had raised it. She hadthe fear of the coachman before her eyes, who was holding his verybreath to listen, growing redder and redder in the effort, but in vain.Lady Piercey projected her head over the carriage door till it almosttouched the young head which Patty held high, with all the flowers andfeathers on her fine hat thrilling. “Look you here!” she said, with thatlow, rolling contralto which sounded like bass in the girl’s very ears,“we’ve ways and means you know nothing about. We’re the great people ofthis county, and you’re no better than the dust under our feet: do youhear? do you hear?”“Oh yes, I hear very well, my lady,” said Patty, loud out, which was adelight to the coachman, “but perhaps I am not of that opinion.” Therewas, however, a little quaver of panic in her voice. Lady Piercey wasright so far that a person of the people, when uneducated, finds itdifficult to free him-, and especially herself, from a superstition asto what the little great, the dominant class can do.“Opinion or no opinion,” said the old lady, “just you understand this,Miss Polly, or whatever your name is: You don’t know what people like uscan do--and will do if we’re put to it. We can put a man away withinstone walls that is going to disgrace himself: we can do that as easy aslook at him; and we can ruin a designing family. That we can! ruin itroot and branch, so that everything will have to be sold up, and thosethat offend us swept out of the country. Do you hear? Everything I say Ican make good. We’ll ruin you all if you don’t mind. We’ll sweep youaway--your name and everything, and will shut him up that you are tryingto work upon, so that you shall never hear of him again. Do youunderstand all that? Now, if you like to think you can fight me and SirGiles, a little thing like you, a little nobody, you can just try it!And whatever happens will be on your own head. Oh, are you back already,John? What haste you have made! Good-bye, Patty; I hope you understandall I’ve said to you. Those chickens, I can tell you, will never behatched. John--home!”Patty stood looking after the carriage with her breast heaving and hernostrils dilating. The old lady had judged truly. She was frightened.Panic had seized her. She believed in these unknown miraculous powers.What could the Seven Thorns do against the Manor House? Patty Hewittagainst Sir Giles and Lady Piercey? It was a question to freeze the veryblood in the veins of a poor little country girl.CHAPTER VIII.But it was not for nothing that Patty had put on her best things:quivering and excited as she was, she would not go in again, howeverdiscouraged, and take them off and return to the usual occupations,which were so very little like the occupations of the great folks of theManor. She went on a little way towards the village very slowly, withall her fine feathers drooping, dragging the point of her lace-coveredparasol along the sandy road. She was genuinely frightened by old LadyPiercey, whom all her life she had been brought up to regard assomething more terrible than the Queen herself. For Her Majesty is knownto be kind, and there are often stories in the newspapers about hergoodness and charity; whereas Lady Piercey, with her deep voice and thetufts of hair on her chin, had an alarming aspect, and notwithstandingher Christmas doles and official charities, was feared and not loved inher parish and district. How was Patty to know how much or how littlethat terrible old lady could do? She was much discouraged by theinterview, in which she felt that she had been cowed and overborne, andhad not stood up with her usual spirit to her adversary. Had Patty knownbeforehand that Gervase’s mother was to come to her thus, she wouldhave proudly determined that Lady Piercey should “get as good as shegave.” But she had been taken by surprise, and the old lady hadcertainly had the best of it. She was of so candid a spirit, that shecould not deny this; certainly Lady Piercey had had the best of it.Patty herself had felt the ground cut from under her feet; she had nothad a word to throw at a dog. She had allowed herself to be frightenedand silenced and set down. It was a very unusual experience for Patty,and for the moment she could not overcome the feeling of having lost thebattle.However, presently her drooping crest began to rise. If Lady Piercey hadbut known the errand upon which Patty was going, the intention withwhich she had dressed herself in all her Sunday clothes, taken hergloves from their box, and her parasol out of its cover! Theconsciousness of what that object had been returned to Patty’s mind in amoment, and brought back the colour to her cheeks. “Ah, my lady! youthink it’s something far off, as you’ve got time to fight against, andshut him up and take him away! If you but knew that it may happento-morrow, or day after to-morrow, and Patty Hewitt become Mrs. GervasePiercey in spite of you!” This thought filled Patty with new energy. Itwould be still sweeter to do it thus, under their very nose, as itwere, after they had driven away triumphant, thinking they had crushedPatty. It was perhaps natural, that in the heat of opposition and risingpugnaciousness, the girl should have turned her bitterest thought uponthe spectator sitting by, who had not said a word, and whose sympathieswere, if not on her side, at least not at all on that of the otherbelligerent. “That white-faced maypole of a thing!” Patty said toherself with a virulence of opposition to the dependent which exists inboth extremes of society. The old lady she recognised as having a rightto make herself as disagreeable as she pleased, but the bystander, thesilent spectator looking on, the cousin, or whatever she was--what hadshe to do with it? Patty clenched her hand, in which she had been limplyholding her parasol, and vowed to herself that that Mrs. Osborne shouldknow who was who before they had done with each other, or she, Patty,would know the reason why. Poor Margaret! who had neither wished to bethere, nor aided and abetted in any way Patty’s momentary discomfiture;but it frequently happens that the victim of the strife is a completelyinnocent person, only accidentally concerned.Stimulated by this corrective of despondency, Patty resumed all hernatural smartness, flung up her head, so that all her artificial flowersthrilled again, raised and expanded her parasol, and marched along likean army with banners, taking up with her own slim person and shadow thewhole of the road. Humbler passersby, even the new curate, who was notyet acquainted with the parishioners, got out of her way, recognisingher importance, and that sentiment as if of everything belonging to herthat was in her walk, in her bearing, and, above all, in the parasol,which was carried, as is done still in Eastern countries, as a symbol ofsovereignty. Mr. Tripley, the curate, stumbled aside upon the grassymargin of the road in his awe and respect, while Patty swept on; thoughthere was something in her members--that love of ancient habit,scientifically known as a survival--which made the impulse to curtsey tohim almost more than she could resist. She did get over it, however, aswise men say we get over the use of a claw or a tail which is no longernecessary to us. Patty went along the high-road as far as the entranceto the village street, and then turned down to where, at the very end ofit, there stood a little house in a little garden which was one of theornaments of the place. It was a house to a stranger somewhat difficultto characterise. It was not the doctor’s or even the schoolmaster’s,still less the curate’s, unless he had happened (as was the case) to bean unmarried young man, who might have been so lucky as to attain tolodgings in that well-cared-for dwelling. But, no; it was to well caredfor to take lodgers, or entertain any extraneous element; it was, inshort, not to be diffuse, the house of Miss Hewitt, the sister ofRichard Hewitt of the Seven Thorns, and aunt to Patty; the very MissHewitt in her own person, who had sat at the window upstairs making thevandyke in tape for her new petticoat, and to whom Sir Giles, in thedays of his youth, and all the gentlemen had taken off their hats. Thosehad been the palmy days of the Seven Thorns, and the Hewitt of thosetimes had been able to leave something to his daughter, which, alongwith a bit of money which she was supposed to have inherited from hermother, had enabled Miss Hewitt to establish herself in great comfort,not to say luxury, in Rose Cottage. It was a small slice of a house,which looked as if it had been cut off from a row and set down alonethere. Its bricks were redder than any other bricks in the village,indeed they were reddened with paint as high up as the parlour window;the steps were whiter, being carefully whitened every day; the door wasvery shiny and polished, almost like the panel of a carriage, in green;the window of the parlour, at the side of the door, was shielded byhangings of spotless starched muslin, and had a small muslin blindsecured across the lower half of it by a band of brass polished likegold. The door had a brass handle and a brass knocker. There was not aweed in the garden, which presented a brilliant border of flowers,concealing the more profitable wealth of a kitchen garden behind.Several great rose bushes were there, justifying the name of thecottage; but Miss Hewitt had taken down those which clustered once uponthe walls, as untidy things which could not be kept in order. RoseCottage was the pride, if also in some respects the laughing-stock, ofthe village; but it was the object of a certain adoration to the membersof the clan of Hewitt, who considered it a credit to them and proof oftheir unblemished respectability far and near.Patty knew too well to invade the virginal purity of the front door, thewhite step, or the brass knocker; but went round through the garden tothe back, where her aunt was busy preparing fruit for the jam, for whichMiss Hewitt was famous, with the frightened little girl, who was hermaid-of-all-work, in attendance. All the little girls who succeededeach other in Miss Hewitt’s service had a scared look; but all the samethey were lucky little girls, and competed for by all the housekeepersround when they attained an age to be handed on to other service ascertain to be admirably trained. She was a trim old lady, a littletaller than Patty, and stouter, as became her years, but with all thevivacity and alertness which distinguished the women of that ancienthouse. She was a person of discernment also, and soon perceived thatthis was not a mere visit of ceremony, but that there was matter foradvice in Patty’s eye, and not that interest in the fruit, and its exactreadiness for preserving, which would have been natural to a young womanin Patty’s position had there been no other object in her mind. MissHewitt accordingly, though with regret, suspended her importantoperations, breathing a secret prayer that the delay might not injurethe colour of her jam, and led the way into the parlour. To describethat parlour would occupy me gratefully for at least a couple of pages,but I forbear. The reader may perhaps be able to fill up the suggestion;if not, he (she?) will probably hear more about it later on.“Well,” said Miss Hewitt, placing herself in her high-backed chair,which no one else presumed to occupy, “what is to do? I could see asyou’d something to tell me of before you were up to the kitchen door.”“I’ve more than something to tell you. I’ve something to ask you,” saidPatty.“I dare say: the one mostly means the other; but you know as I’m notfoolish, nor even to say free with my money, if that’s it, knowing thevalley of it more than the likes of you.”“I know that,” said Patty; “and it ain’t for anything connected with thehouse or the business that I’d ever ask you, auntie; but this is formyself, and I sha’n’t go about the bush or make any explanations tillI’ve just told you frank; it’s a matter of thirty pounds.”“Thirty pounds! the gell is out of her senses!” Miss Hewitt cried.“Or thereabouts. I don’t know for certain; but you, as knows a deal morethan me, may. It’s for a marriage-licence,” said Patty, looking her auntfull in the face.“A marriage-licence!” Miss Hewitt repeated again, in tones ofconsternation; “and what does the fool want with a licence as costsmoney, when you can put up the banns, as is far more respectable, and bemarried the right way.”“I don’t know as there’s anything that ain’t respectable in a licence,and anyway it’s the only thing,” said Patty, “for him and me. If I can’tget it, I’ll have to let it alone, that’s all. A marriage as mightn’t beanything much for the moment, but enough to make the hair stand uprighton your head, Aunt Patience, all the same!”“What kind of marriage would that be?” said the old lady, sceptical yetinterested; “that fine Roger of yours, maybe, as is probable to be madea lord for his battin’ and his bowlin’. Lord! Patty, how you can be sucha fool, a niece of mine!”“I ain’t such a fool,” said Patty, growing red, “though it might bebetter for me if I was. But anyhow I am your niece, as you say, and Ican’t--be that kind of fool; maybe I’m a bigger fool, if it’s true asthat old witch at the Manor says.”“What old witch?” cried the other old witch in the parlour, pricking upher ears.“Aunt Patience,” cried Patty, “you as knows: can they lock up in amadhouse a young man as isn’t mad, no more than you or me; but is justsilly, as any one of us might be? Can they put him out of his property,or send for the Lord Chancellor and take everything from him to his veryname? Oh, what’s the use of asking who he is? Who could he be? thereain’t but one like that in all this county, and you know who he is aswell as I do. Mr. Gervase Piercey. Sir Giles’ son and heir! and they’vegot neither chick nor child but him!”“Patty,” said the elder woman, laying a grip like that of a bird withclaws upon her niece’s arm, “is it _’im_ as you want the thirty poundsfor to buy the licence? Tell me straight out, and not a word more.”“It is _him_,” said Patty, in full possession of her h’s, and with agravity that became the importance of the occasion. Miss Hewitt did notsay a word. She rose from her chair, and, proceeding to the window,pulled down the thick linen blind. She then placed a chair against thedoor. Then she took from the recess near the fireplace an old workbox,full to all appearance, when she opened it with a key which she tookout of her purse, with thread and needles of various kinds. Underneaththis, when she had taken the shelf completely out, appeared somethingwrapt in a handkerchief half-hemmed, with a threaded needle stuck init--as if it had been a piece of work put aside--which proved to be anold pocketbook. She held this in her hand for a moment only, gave Pattya look, full of suspicion, scrutiny, yet subdued enthusiasm; then sheopened it and took out carefully three crisp and crackling notes,selecting them one by one from different bundles. Then with greatdeliberation she put notes, pocketbook, the covering shelf, of theworkbox, and the box itself back into the place where it had stoodbefore.“Mind, now you’ve seen it, I’ll put it all into another place,” MissHewitt said; “so you may tell whoever you like, they won’t find itthere.”“Why should I tell?” said Patty; “it’s more for my interest you shouldkeep it safe.”“You think you’ll get it all when I die,” said the elder woman, sittingdown opposite to her niece with the notes in her hand.“I think, as I hope, you’ll never die, Aunt Patience! but always behere to comfort and help a body when they’re in trouble, like me.”“Do you call yourself in trouble? I call you as lucky as ever girl was.I’d have given my eyes for the chance when I was like you; but hisfather was too knowing a one, and never gave it to me. Here! you askedfor thirty, and I’ve give you fifty. Don’t you go and put off andshilly-shally, but strike while the iron’s hot. And there’s a littleover to go honeymooning upon. Of course he’s got no money--the Softy:but I know ’im; he’s no more mad than you or me.”She ended with a long, low laugh of exultation and satisfaction whichmade even Patty, excited and carried away by the tremendous step in herlife thus decided upon, feel the blood chilled in her veins.“You think there’s no truth, then, in what Lady Piercey said: that theycould take everything from him, even to his name?” It was the hesitationof this chill and horror which brought such a question to Patty’s lips.Miss Hewitt laughed again. “The Manor estate is all entailed,” she said,“and the rest they’ll never get Sir Giles to will away--never! All themore if there’s a chance of an heir, who ought to have all his witsabout him, Patty, from one side of the house. Get along with you, girl!You’re the luckiest girl as ever I knew!”But, nevertheless, it was with a slower step and a chill upon all herthoughts that Patty went back, without even putting up her parasol,though the sun from the west shone level into her eyes, to the SevenThorns.CHAPTER IX.For a few days after Patty’s visit to her aunt, that young lady lookedout with some eagerness for the reappearance of Gervase at the SevenThorns, but looked in vain. At first she scarcely remarked his absence,having many things to think of, for it was not without excitement thatshe planned out the steps by which she was to enter into a new life. Thefirst evening was filled, indeed, with the events of the day; the mentalcommotion called forth by the visit of Lady Piercey, and the excitement,almost overwhelming, of her unexpected, enthusiastic reception by MissHewitt, and the sudden supply so much above her most daring hopes. Fiftypounds! it was more to Patty than as many thousands would have been tominds more accustomed--much more. For the possession of a great deal ofmoney means only income, and an unknown treasure in somebody else’shands, whereas fifty pounds is absolute money, which you can change, andspend, and realise, and enjoy down to the last farthing. It gave her agreat deal of anxiety how to dispose of it at first. The Seven Thornswas not a place where any thief was likely to come for money; it was nota house worth robbing, which was a point, as Patty with her excellentsense was aware, on which burglars are very particular, taking everycare to obtain accurate information. But then, again, money is a thingthat betrays itself--a secret that is carried by the birds of the air.Had there been any of these gentry about, he might have divined from theway in which she carried herself, that she had fifty pounds in herpocket. There was a little faint lightness about it, she thought, whenshe put it in her drawer--a sort of undeveloped halo, showing thatsomething precious was in the old pocketbook which she had found toenshrine it in. Then she took it out of that formal receptacle, andplaced it with scientific carelessness in an old envelope. But,immediately, that torn paper covering seemed to become important, too,among the pocket-handkerchiefs and cherished trumpery, beads andbrooches in her “locked drawer.” The “girl,” who was the only servant,except the ostler, at the Seven Thorns, had always manifested a greatcuriosity (taken rather as a compliment to her treasures than as anoffence by Patty) concerning the contents of that locked drawer. She hadoften asked to be shown the “jewellery,” which Patty, indeed, had noobjection to show. What if she would be tempted this night of all othersto break open the drawer, to refresh her soul with gazing at them, andperhaps to throw the old dirty envelope away? It was highly improbablethat poor Ellen, an honest creature, would break open the drawer. Butstill, everything is possible when you have fifty pounds to take careof. Patty took it out again and placed it first in her pocket--but shesoon felt that to be quite too insecure--and then in her bosom under hertrim little bodice. She felt it there, while she went about her usualoccupations, carrying beer to her father’s customers. Fancy carryingpots of beer to labourers that were not worth so much as the price ofthem, and thanking the clowns for twopence--a girl who had fifty poundsunder the bodice of her cotton frock! She was glad to see that Gervasehad obeyed her orders, and did not appear in the parlour among the dulldrinkers there.Next day Patty was much occupied in rummaging out the empty part of thehouse, the best rooms, once occupied by important guests, when the SevenThorns was a great coaching establishment, but now vacant, tapestriedwith dust and cobwebs, rarely opened from one year’s end to the other,except at the spring-cleaning, when it is the duty of every housekeeperto clear out all the corners. She got up very early in the summermornings, before any one was stirring (and it may be imagined how earlythat was, for the Seven Thorns was all alert and in movement by sixo’clock), and went in to make an inspection while she was secure fromany disturbance. The best rooms were in the western end of the longhouse, quite removed from the bar and the parlour, the chief windowslooking out upon the garden, and at a distance upon the retreating lineof the high road, and the slope of the heathery downs. Patty’s heartswelled with pleasure as she carefully opened the shutters and lookedround at the old faded furniture. There was a good-sized sitting-room,and two or three other rooms communicating with each other, andseparated by a long passage from the other part of the house. “A suiteof apartments,” she said to herself! for Patty had read novels, and wasacquainted with many fine terms of expression. The early sunshineflooded all the silent country, showing a dewy glimmer in the neglectedgarden, and sweeping along the broad and vacant road, where as yet therewas nothing stirring. A few cows in a field, one of which got slowly upto crop a morsel before breakfast, as fine ladies (and fine gentlemen,too) have a cup of tea in bed, startled Patty as by the movement of someone spying upon her unusual operations and wondering what they meant.But there was no other spectator, nothing else awake, except the earlybirds who were chattering about their own businesses in every tree,talking over their own suites of apartments, and the repairs wanted,before the professional occupations of the day began, and the pipes weretuned up. They were far too busy to pay any attention to Patty, nor didshe mind them. Besides, they were all sober, married folks, with thecare of their families upon their heads; while she was a young personall thrilling with the excitement of the unknown, and making a secretsurvey of the possible future nest.Patty inspected these rooms with a careful and a practised eye. Anyyoung couple in the land, she felt, might be proud to possess this suiteof apartments. She examined the carpets to see whether they would do,whether they would bear a thorough beating, which they required, andwhether by judicious application of gall, or other restoring fluid, thecolour might be brought back to the part which had been most trodden; orwhether it would be better to buy one of those new-fashioned rugs whichwere spread upon the matting in the Rectory--a poor sort of substitutefor a carpet, Patty had always thought--but as it was the fashion, itmight be adopted to cover deficiencies; or a nice round table with acover might be placed upon that weak spot. Curtains would be necessary,but thin white muslin is cheap and could be easily supplied. Pattypulled the old furniture about, as the rector’s wife had done on herfirst arrival, to give it a careless look, which does not suit the sternangles of early Victorian mahogany and haircloth; but Patty had greatconfidence in crochet and frilled muslin to cover a multitude of sins.She stood at the window and looked out upon the garden which was quiteretired and genteel--as refined a view as could have been had in theManor itself. The cow in the field had lain down again to finish hernight’s rest after that early cup of tea. It was so quiet: the morning’ssunshine almost level in long rays on the grass, the sleek coat of thebrown cow glistening, nobody stirring. It almost overawed Patty to lookout upon that wonderful silence before the world was awake. There was notelling what might happen in that new day; there was no telling whatmight come to her in the new life upon the margin of which she stood.She did not, I need scarcely say, think of the ideal excellencies of herfuture husband, or of love, or any of the usual enchantments thatbrighten the beginning of life. She thought of the Manor; of the oldpeople who would soon die and be out of the way; of Lady Piercey’scarriage, which would be hers; of the coachman and John on the box, whomshe had been at school with (John at least), and whom she would make totremble before her when her turn came to be my lady. My lady! Patty’shead turned round and round. She put her head upon the window-frame tosupport herself, turning giddy with the thought. Your ladyship! Shecould hear people say it reverentially who had called, as if she hadbeen their servant, for Patty at the Seven Thorns.This was the thought that filled her mind with something of thatineffable elation and delight in her own happiness which is supposed tobe peculiar to people who are in love. Patty was in love; but it wouldbe putting a scorn upon her intelligence to suppose that she was in lovewith Gervase. Poor Gervase, the Softy! Patty was resolved to be verygood to him--she had even a kind of affection for him as being her ownto do what she pleased with. He should never have any reason to regrether ownership. She would be good to him in every way, deny him nothing,consider all his silly tastes as well as his serious interests. But whatPatty was in love with was the Manor, and the carriage, and the rents,and the ladyship. Lady Piercey! The thought of that tingled to her veryfeet; it turned her head like wine. The old people, of course, wouldmake themselves very disagreeable. It would be their part to do so.Patty felt that she would think no worse of them for fighting againsther, tooth and nail. But they would have to give in at the end; or stillbetter, they would die and get out of her way, which was the mostprobable thing. Young people generally think of the death of old peoplewithout compunction; it is their business to die, just as it is thebusiness of their successors to live. It is the course of nature. Pattyno more doubted they would die than that Christmas would come in sixmonths, whatever happened. What she would have chosen for pleasure andto enhance her triumph to the utmost, was that old Sir Giles should die,and the old lady survive to be called the Dowager, and to see Pattybearing the title of Lady Piercey. This was what would be most sweet;and it was very likely to come to pass, for everybody knew that SirGiles was a great invalid, whereas nobody knew that Lady Piercey hadbeen attacked last year by a little, very little premonitory“stroke”--nobody, at least, except Parsons and Margaret Osborne and thedoctor, with none of whom Patty had any communication. The greatesttriumph she could think of was to see the Dowager bundled off to herdower-house, while she, Patty, the regnant Lady Piercey, took her place.She was not an ill-natured person on the whole, but she felt that therewas here awaiting her a poignant joy.In the meantime, however, this glory was still at a distance, and thefirst thing to do was to prepare a shelter for the young couple whowould have to inhabit, for lack of other habitation, these rooms in thewest end of the Seven Thorns. Patty interviewed her father on thesubject as soon as he had eaten his breakfast. She told him that toleave these beautiful rooms unoccupied was a sin and shame, and that itwas his plain duty to do them up and look out for a lodger for nextsummer. “Indeed, I’m not sure but we might hear of somebody this seasonstill, if they were ready,” she said. She showed him all thecapabilities of the place, and how a disused garden door might bearranged so as to form a separate entrance, “for gentry won’t come in bya public-house door. It ain’t likely,” she explained. “What do I careabout gentry, and what do you know about ’em?” said her father. “I’llnever spend my money on such nonsense.” “But you like to see the colourof theirs,” said Patty, “and it would be good for trade, too. Forsuppose you gave them their board for a fixed rate, there would alwaysbe a good profit. It would keep us going and them, too, so as we shouldpay nothing for our living, and that in addition to the rent: don’t yousee, father?” “I don’t believe in them profits,” said the old man;“gentry, as you call ’em, don’t eat the same things as I likes.” “Butthey’d have to, father,” said Patty, softly, “if they couldn’t getnothing else.” This struck Mr. Hewitt’s sense of humour, and he allowedthat it might be possible so, with a chuckle of democratic enjoyment.“I’d like to see ’em sit down with their mincin’ ways to beans and fatbacon,” he confessed. Patty was very sure that it was not on beans andfat bacon that she would feed the future Sir Gervase and Lady Piercey;but she made no remark on this point, and ere the week was over, she hadall her plans in operation--the new entrance by the garden, the rods putup for the new muslin curtains, the old rooms scrubbed and polished, anddusted till they shone again. “I think I’ll take a run up to London, andbuy two or three little things out of my own little bit of money,” shesaid cautiously. And though her father demanded what little bit of moneyshe had to spend, he made no objection to the expedition. Patty was verywell to be trusted to look after herself, as well as the interests ofthe family. And thus she prepared, in every respect, the way.But Gervase never appeared. Morning and night she looked out for him,pleased and half-amused, at first, with the faithfulness with which heobeyed her. But after a time Patty became a little anxious. She had,indeed, forbidden him to come to the Seven Thorns. But she had notintended this self-sacrifice to be of such long duration. What if hismother had got hold of him? What if he had been frightened into givingup his love? The old lady had looked very masterful, very full of powerto do mischief. What if they had shut him up? Patty grew more and moreanxious as day followed day. The fifty pounds which she had sewn up in alittle bag, and wore suspended by a ribbon round her neck, began to lielike a blister upon her pretty white skin underneath her bodice. Whatwould Aunt Patience say if all her plans came to nothing, if no licencewas necessary, and no bridegroom forthcoming? Patty felt her heart sink,sink into unimaginable depths. The old woman would reclaim her moneywith a sneer enough to drive any girl mad. She would laugh out at thefool that had fancied the Softy was in love with her. His father, as hadall his wits about him, might take a person in; but Lord bless us, theSofty! Patty knew exactly what her aunt would say. Miss Hewitt had givenher the money, not for love of her, but that she might triumph over thegreat people, and avenge the wrongs of the other Patty who had gonebefore her. Patty grew hot and grew cold, as she stood at the doorlooking out along the road, and seeing nobody; her heart sickened atevery footstep, and leaped at every shadow on the way. One night, whenshe stood there with her face turned persistently in one direction, justas the soft summer twilight was stealing over the landscape, andeverything was growing indistinct, a voice close to her made Patty jump.She had not even observed--so great was her preoccupation--anotherfigure coming round the other corner. Roger Pearson had seated himselfon the bench under the parlour window, and yet she had taken no notice.He broke the silence by a laugh of mockery, that seemed to Patty thebeginning of the ridicule and scorn of the whole parish. “Looking outfor some one, eh?” said the voice; “but he ain’t coming, not to-night.”“Who is not coming, Mr. Pearson?” said Patty, commanding herself with agreat effort; “some one you were expecting to meet?”“You can’t come over me like that, Patty,” said Roger. “Lord,a nice lass like you that might have the best fellow in thevillage--a-straining and a-wearing your eyes looking after a Softy! andhim not coming neither--not a step! They knows better than that.”“I don’t know what you mean, Mr. Pearson,” said Patty, feeling herselfenveloped from head to foot in a flush of rage and shame. “I don’t knowas I ever was known as one that looked after Softies--meaning poor folksthat have lost their wits, I suppose. You’re one of them, anyhow, thatspeaks like that to me.”“I wouldn’t if I were you,” said the young man, in his deep voice--“afellow that’s not fit to tie your shoe, though he may be the squire’sson. Don’t you think that’ll ever come to any good. They’ll never letyou be my lady; don’t you think it. They’ll turn him out o’ doors, andthey’ll cut him off with a shilling; and then you’ll find yourselfwithout a penny and a fool on your hands instead of a man.”“Is this something out of a story book, or is it out of his own head?”said Patty looking round her as if consulting an impartialaudience,--“anyway, it has nothing to say to me. I’ll send Ellen to youfor your orders, Mr. Pearson, for I’ve got a lot to do to-night, and Ican’t stand here to listen to your romancing. Ellen,” she cried, “justsee to that gentleman.” She went off with all the honours of war, butPatty’s heart was likely to burst. She marched upstairs with a candle tothe rooms she had been arranging so carefully, and locked the door, andsat down upon the sofa and gave way to a torrent of tears. Was it all tocome to nothing, after all her splendid dreams? She knew as well as anyone that he was a fool and could be persuaded into anything. How did sheknow that his mother, if she tried, could not turn him round her littlefinger, as she, Patty, had been certain she could do? How could shetell, in the battle between Lady Piercey of Greyshott and Patty of theSeven Thorns, that it was she who would triumph and not the great lady?It was all Patty could do not to shriek out her exasperation, her miseryand rage; not to pull down the curtains and dash the furniture topieces. She caught her handkerchief with her teeth and tore it to keepherself quiet--and the fifty pounds in the bag burnt her breast like ablister. What if it was to come to nothing, after all?CHAPTER X.The week had been a very long week to Gervase. To him, poor fellow,there was no limit of time; no thought that his obedience was intended,nay, desired to stop at a certain point. He went on dully, keeping athome, keeping indoors, trying in his fatuous way to please his parents.It was a very dull round to him who had known the livelier joys of theSeven Thorns, the beer and the tobacco in the parlour, and Pattyflitting about, throwing him a word from time to time. It seemed but apoor sort of paradise to sit among the slow old topers in the smokyroom and imbibe the heavy beer; but it is unfortunately a kind ofenjoyment which many young men prefer to the fireside at home, evenwithout any addition of a Patty; and the poor Softy was not in thisrespect so very much inferior to the best and cleverest. The fireside athome, it must be allowed, was not very exciting. To be sure, the roomitself was a very different room from that of the Seven Thorns. It wasnot the drawing-room in which the Piercey family usually sat in theevening, for the drawing-room was upstairs, and Sir Giles could not betaken up without great difficulty in his wheeled chair. It was thelibrary, a large long room, clothed with the mellow tones and subduedgilding of old books, making a background which would have been quitebeautiful to an artist. There was a row of windows on one side veiled inlong curtains, and between these windows a series of family portraitsalmost as long as the windows, full length, not very visible in the dimlight, affording a little glimpse of colour, and a face here and therelooking out from that height upon the little knot of living peoplebelow; but the Pierceys of the past were not remarkable any more thanthe present Pierceys. A shaded lamp was suspended by a very long chainfrom the high roof, which was scarcely discernible going up so far, withthose glimmers of bookcases and tall old portraits leading towards thevague height above; beneath it was a small round table, at which LadyPiercey sat in a great chair with her bright-coloured work; on the otherside was Sir Giles among his cushions, with his backgammon board on astand beside him, where sometimes Margaret, sometimes Dunning playedwith him till bedtime. Parsons, on the other hand, was so frequently inattendance on her mistress that the two old servants might be taken aspart of the family circle. When Margaret took her place at thebackgammon board, Dunning had an hour’s holiday, and retired to the muchbrighter atmosphere of the servants’ hall or the housekeeper’s room. Andwhen Dunning played with Sir Giles, Margaret attended upon Lady Pierceyto thread her needles, and select the shades of the silk, and Parsonswas set free. The one who was never set free was Mrs. Osborne, whoseevenings in this dim room between the two old people were passed in anendless monotony which sometimes made her giddy. The dull wheel of lifewent round and round for her, and never stopped or had any difference init. From year to year the routine was the same.Now, whether this scene, or the parlour at the Seven Thorns, where thesages of the village opened their mouths every five minutes or so toemit a remark or a mouthful of smoke, or to take in a draught of beer,was the most--or rather the least--enlivening, it would be hard to say.The sages of the village are sometimes dull and sometimes wise in abook. They were full of humour and character in George Eliot’srepresentation of them, and they are very quaint in Mr. Hardy’s. But Idoubt much if they ever say such fine things in reality, and I am sure,if they did, that Gervase Piercey was not capable of understanding them.The beer and the tobacco and the sense of freedom and of pleasinghimself--also of being entirely above his company, and vaguely respectedby them--made up the charms of the humbler place to Gervase. AndPatty--Patty had got by degrees to be the soul of all; but even beforePatty’s reign began he had escaped with delight from these home eveningsto the Seven Thorns. Why? For Sir Giles, even in his enfeebled state,was better company than old Hewitt and his cronies; and Lady Piercey’ssharp monologue on things in general was more piquant than anything theold labourers found to say; and Mrs. Osborne was a great deal handsomerthan Patty, and would willingly have exerted herself for the amusementof her cousin. But this is a problem to which there is no answer. Farbetter and cleverer young men than Gervase make this same choice everyday, or rather every evening; and no one can tell why.But Gervase had turned over a new leaf. He went out to the door and tooka few whiffs of his pipe, turning his back to the road which led to theSeven Thorns, that the temptation might not be too much for him, andrepeating dully to himself what Patty had said to him. And then he wentinto the library, where they were all assembled, and pushed Dunningaway, who was just arranging the board for Sir Giles’ game. “Here! lookout; I’m going to play with you, father,” Gervase said. The oldgentleman had been delighted the first night, pleased more or less thesecond, fretful the third. “You don’t understand my play, Gervase,” hesaid.“Oh! yes, I understand your play, father: Dunning lets you win, andthat’s why you like Dunning to play with you; but I’m better, for I wakeyou up, and you’ve got to fight for it when it’s me.”“Dunning does nothing of the sort,” cried Sir Giles, angrily, “Dunningplays a great deal better than you, you booby. Do you let me win,Dunning? It’s all he knows!”“I ought to be good, Sir Giles, playin’ with a fine player like you; butI never come up to you, and never will, for I haven’t the eddication youhave, Sir Giles, which stands to reason, as I’m only a servant,” Dunningsaid.“There! You hear him: go and play something with Meg; you’re never stillwith those long legs of yours, and I like a quiet game.”“I’ll keep as quiet as pussy,” said Gervase. “Which’ll you have,father, black or white? and let’s toss for the first move.”Now, everybody knew that Sir Giles always played with the white men andalways had the first move. Once again the old gentleman had to resignhimself to the noisy moves and shouts of his son over every newcombination, and to the unconscious kicks which the restlessness ofGervase’s long limp legs inflicted right and left. Dunning stood behindhis master’s chair, with a stern face of disapproval, yet trying hard bywinks and nods to indicate the course which ought to be pursued, untilGervase threw himself back in his chair, almost kicking over the tablewith the corresponding movement of his legs, and bursting into a loudlaugh. “What d’ye mean, ye old fool, making faces at me over father’sshoulder? Do you mean I’m to give him the game, like you do? Come on,father, let’s fight it out.”“I never said a word, Sir Giles! I hope as I knows my place,” criedDunning, alarmed.“Hold your tongue, you big gaby,” cried Sir Giles; but presently the oldgentleman thrust the board away, overturning it upon his son’s longlegs. “I’ll not play any more,” he said: “I’ve had enough of it. Ithink I was never so tired in my life. Backgammon’s a fine game, but onecan’t go on for ever. Fetch me my drink, Dunning; I think I’ll go tobed.”“It’s all because he’s losing his game,” cried Gervase, with a loud ha!ha! He had something like the manners of a gentleman at the SevenThorns, but at home his manners were those of the public-house. “The oldman don’t like to be beaten; he likes to have everything his own way.And Dunning’s an old humbug, and lets you have it. But it ain’t good foryou to have too much of your own way. I’ve been told _that_ since I wasa little kid like Osy; and what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for thegander, father, don’t you know.”“Gervase, how dare you speak so to your papa? Come over here, sir, andleave him a little in peace. Where did you learn to laugh so loud, andmake such a noise? Come here, you riotous boy. You always were a noisyfellow, making one’s head ache to hear you. Sit down, for goodness’sake, and be quiet. Meg, can’t you find something to amuse him? I daresay he’d like a game at cards. How can I tell you what game? If youcan’t, at your time of life, find something that will occupy him andkeep him quiet----! Here, Gervase, hold this skein of silk whileParsons winds it, and Meg will go and get the cards, and perhaps you’dlike a round game.”“I don’t want a game, mother, not for Meg’s sake, who doesn’t count. Iwant to be pleasant to you---- and to father, too,” said Gervase,standing up against the fireplace, which, of course, was vacant thissummer night.Sir Giles was so far from appreciating the effort of his son, that hesat fuming in his chair, while Dunning collected the scattered “men,”muttering indistinct thunders, and pettishly putting away with his stickthe pieces of the game. “Make haste! can’t you make haste, man?” hemumbled; “I want my drink, and I’m going to bed. And I won’t have myevening spoiled like this again. I won’t, by George, not for anythingyou can say. Four nights I’ve been a martyr to that cub, and I don’t seethat you’ve done much to keep him in order, my lady! It all falls uponme, as everything does, and, by George, I won’t have it again. Can’t youmake haste, you old fool, and have done with your groping? You’re losingyour eyesight, I believe. Have one of the women in to find them, andget me my drink, for I’m going to bed.”“I’ll find them, father,” cried Gervase cheerfully, plunging down uponthe carpet on his hands and knees, and pushing the old gentleman’s stickback into his face.“For goodness’ sake, Meg, find something for him to do! and take thatboy off his father, or Sir Giles will have a fit,” cried Lady Piercey inMrs. Osborne’s ear.“Get out o’ my way, you young ass!” Sir Giles thundered, raising thestick and bestowing an angry blow upon his son’s shoulders. Gervase satup on his knees like a dog, and stared for a moment angrily, with hishand lifted as if he would have returned the blow. Then he opened hismouth wide and gave forth a great laugh. Poor old Sir Giles caught atDunning’s arm, clutching him in an ecstasy of exasperation. “Get me off,man, can’t you? Get me out of sight of him; take me to bed,” the oldfather cried, in that wretchedness of miserable perception which onlyparents know. His son--his only son! His heir, the last of thePiercey’s!--this Softy sitting up like a dog upon the floor!Lady Piercey fell back also in her chair, and whimpered a littlepiteously, like the poor old woman she was, as Sir Giles was wheeled outof the room. The backgammon board, overturned, lay on the floor, withthe pieces scattered over the carpet, and Gervase scrambling after them,for Dunning had been too tremulous and frightened to pick more than halfof them up. “Oh! my poor, silly boy! oh! you dreadful, dreadful fool!”the old lady cried. “Will you never learn any better? Can’t you wake upand be a man?” She cried over this, for a little, very bitterly, withthat terrible sense of the incurable which turns the poor soul back uponitself--and then she flung round in her big chair towards her niece, whostood silent and troubled, not knowing what part to take. “It’s allyour fault,” she cried in a fierce whisper, “for not finding somethingfor him to do. Why didn’t you find something for him to do? You mighthave played something to him, or sung something with him, or got him tolook at pictures, or---- anything! And now you’ve let your poor uncle gooff in a rage, which may bring on a fit as likely as not, and me worse,for I can’t give in like him. Oh, Meg, what an ungrateful, selfish thingyou are to stand there and never interfere when you might have found himsomething to do!”When Lady Piercey’s procession streamed off afterwards to bed, my ladyleaning heavily on Parsons’ arm and Margaret following with the work,Gervase was left still picking up the pieces, sprawling over the carpetand laughing as he followed the little round pieces of ivory and woodinto the corners where they had rolled. Margaret went back to thelibrary after being released by her aunt, and found him still theremaking a childish game of this for his own amusement, and chuckling tohimself as he raced them over the carpet. He scrambled up, however, alittle ashamed when he heard her voice asking, “What are you doing,Gervase?” “Oh, nothing,” he said with his foolish laugh, stuffing the“men” into his pockets. She put her hand upon his shoulder kindly.“Gervase, dear, you’re quite grown up, don’t you know; quite a man now.You mustn’t be so mischievous, just like a boy. Poor Uncle Giles, youmust not play tricks upon him; he likes a quiet game.”“Don’t you be a fool, Meg. Why, that was what I was doing all the night,playing his quiet game. Poor old father, he got into a temper, but blessyou ’twasn’t my fault. It’s that old ass, Dunning, that’s always gettingin everybody’s way.”“Of course he would like you best, Gervase,--but Dunning knows all hisways. Your game might be better fun----”“I should think so,” said the poor Softy. “My game _is_ the game, andDunning spoils everything. It ain’t my fault, though every one of yougets into a wax with me,”--Gervase’s lip quivered a little as if hemight have cried,--“and me giving up everything only to please them!” hesaid.“I am sure they are pleased to see you always indoors and not spendingyour time in that dreadful place.”“What dreadful place? That is all you know--I’d never have come homeany more but for them that’s there. It was _she_ that sent me to pleasethe old folks. But I shan’t go on much longer if you all treat me likethis. I’ve tried my best to make the time pass for them, Meg, to givethem a laugh and that. And they huff me and cuff me as if I was a fool.Why do they always call me a fool,” cried the poor fellow with a passingcloud of trouble, “whatever I do?”“Oh, Gervase!” cried Margaret, full of pity. “But why did she want youso particularly to please them just now?”He stared at her for a moment, then laughed and nodded his head. “You’djust like to know!” he said, “but she didn’t mean me to be nice to_you_, Meg; for she’s always afraid I’ll be driven to marry you--thougha man must not marry his grandmother, you know.”Margaret repented in a moment of the flush of anger that flew over her.“You can make her mind easy on that point,” she said gravely; “but oh,Gervase, I am afraid it will make them very unhappy if you go on withthis fancy; they would never let you bring her here.”“Fancy!” he cried, “I’m going to marry her. You can’t call that a fancy;and if you think you can put me off it, or the whole world!--Get alongMeg, _I_ don’t want to talk to you any more.”“But I want very much to talk to you, Gervase.”Gervase looked at her with a smile of foolish complacency. “I dare sayyou think me silly,” he cried, “but here’s two of you after me. Getalong, Meg; whatever I do I’m not going to take your way.”“You must do as you please, then,” said Margaret in despair; “butremember, Gervase,” she said, turning back before she reached the door,“your father is old, and you might drive him into a fit if you go on asyou did to-night--and where would you be then?” she added, with anappeal to the better feeling in which she still believed.“Why, I’d be in his place, and she’d be my lady,” cried the young man,with a gleam of cruel cunning, “and nobody could stop me any more,whatever I liked to do.”But next evening there seemed to be in his mind some lingering regardfor what she had said. Gervase left his father alone, and devotedhimself to his mother, who was more able to take care of herself. Heoffered to wind her silks, and entangled them hopelessly with delightedpeals of laughter. He took her scissors to snip off the ends for her,and put the sharp points through the canvas, until Lady Piercey, in herexasperation, gave him a sudden cuff on his cheek.“You great fool!” she cried--“you malicious wretch! Do you want to spoilmy work as well as everything else? I wish you were little enough to bewhipped, I do; and I wish I had whipped you when you were little, whenit might have done you some good. Margaret, what do you mean sittingquiet there, enjoying yourself with a book and me driven out of mysenses? That’s what he wants to do, I believe--to drive us mad and gethis own way; to make us crazy, both his poor father and me.”“No, I don’t,” cried Gervase, “and you oughtn’t to hit me--I’ll hit backagain if you do it again. It hurts--you’ve got a fist like a butcher,though you’re such an old lady.” He rubbed his cheek for a momentdolefully, and then again burst out laughing. “You look like old Judy inthe show, mamma, when she hits her baby: only you’re so fat you couldnever get into it, and your voice is gruff like the old showman’s--notsqueaky, like Mrs. Punch. I’ve cut all the silks into nice lengths foryou to work with--ain’t you obliged to me? Look here,” he said, holdingout his work. Poor Lady Piercey clapped her fat hands together loudly insheer incapacity of expression. It made a loud report like a gun firedoff to relieve her feelings, and Sir Giles looked up from his quiet gamewith Dunning, not without a subdued amusement that she should now begetting her share.“What’s the matter, what’s the matter, my lady? Is that cub of yoursplaying some of his pranks? It’s your turn to-night, it appears, andserves you right, for you always back him up.”“Oh, you fool, you fool, you fool!” cried the old lady in her passion.And then she turned her fiery eyes on her husband with a look ofcontempt and fury too great for words. “Meg!” she cried, putting out herhand across the table and grasping Mrs. Osborne’s arm, “If you’re everdriven wild like me, never you look for sympathy to a man! when they seeyou nearly mad with trouble they give you a look, and chuckle! that’swhat they always do. Put down the scissors, you, you, you----”“Oh, and to think,” she cried wildly, “that that’s my only son! Oh,Giles, how can you play your silly games, and sit and see him--the onlyone we have between us, and he’s a born fool! And me, that was sothankful to see him stay at home, and give up going out to his lowcompany! And now I can’t abide him. I can’t abide to see him here!”This happened on the night when Patty, frightened and dejected, shutherself up in the room which she had meant for her bridal bower, andcried her eyes out because of Gervase’s absence. The poor Softy was thusof as much importance as any hero, turning houses and hearts upsidedown.CHAPTER XI.A whole week, and nothing had been seen or heard of Gervase at the SevenThorns. Even old Hewitt remarked it, with a taunt to his daughter.“Where’s your Softy, that was never out of the house, Miss Patty, eh?Don’t seem to be always about at your apron string, my lass, as youthought you was to keep him there. Them gentlemen,” said old Hewitt, “asI’ve told you, Softy or not, they takes their own way, and there’s notrust to be put in them. He’s found some one else as he likes better, ormaybe you’ve given him the sack, Patty, eh? And that’s a pity, for hewas a good customer,” the landlord said.“Whether I’ve given him the sack or he’s found some one he likes better,don’t matter much to any one as I can see. I’ll go to my work, father,if you’ve got nothing more sensible than that to say.”“Sensible or not, he’s gone, and a good riddance,” said her father. “Iain’t a fine Miss, thick with the rector and the gentry, like you; but Ideclare, to see that gaby laughing and gaping at the other side of thetable, turned me sick, it did. And I hopes as we’ll see no more of him,nor none of his kind. If you will have a sweetheart, there’s plenty ofgood fellows about, ’stead of a fool like that.”Patty did not stamp her foot as she would have liked to do, or throw outher arms, or scream with rage and disappointment. She went on knockingher broom into all the corners, taking it out more or less in that way,and tingling from the bunch of hair fashionably dressed on the top ofher head, to the toe of her high-heeled shoes, with suppressed passion.She would not make an exhibition of herself. She would not give Ellen,the maid-servant, closely observing her through the open door of theback kitchen, nor Bob, the ostler, who had also heard every word oldHewitt said as he bustled about with his pail outside the house, anyoccasion of remark or of triumph over her as a maiden forsaken, whoselove had ridden away. They were all on the very tiptoe of expectation,having already made many comments to each other on the subject. “You’reall alike--every one of you,” Ellen had said to Bob. “You’d go andforsake me just the same, if you saw some one as you liked better.”“It’ll be a long day afore I do that,” said the gallant ostler,preserving, however, the privilege of his sex. They were all ready tothrow the responsibility of attraction upon the woman. It was more toher credit to keep her hold on the man by being always delightful tohim than by any bond of faithfulness on his part. Patty felt this to thebottom of her heart. It was not so much that she blamed her Softy. Sheblamed herself bitterly, and felt humiliated and ashamed that she hadnot been able to hold him; that he had found anything he liked betterthan her society. She swept out every corner, banging her broom as ifshe were punishing the unknown rivals who had seduced him away from her,and felt, for all her pride, as if she never could hold up her headagain before the parish, which would thus know that she hadmiscalculated her powers. Roger Pearson knew it already, and triumphed.And then Aunt Patience--but that was the most dreadful of all.Even old Hewitt himself, the landlord of the Seven Thorns, was a littledisappointed, if truth were told. He had liked to say to the fathers ofthe village, “I can’t get that young Piercey out o’ my house. Morning,noon, and night that young fellow is about. And I can’t kick him out, yesee, old Sir Giles bein’ the Lord o’ the Manor.” “I’d kick him out fastenough,” the blacksmith had replied, who never had any chance that way,“if he come sneakin’ after my gell.” “Oh, as for that, my Patty is onethat can take care of herself,” it had been Mr. Hewitt’s boast to say.And when he was congratulated ironically by the party in the parlourwith a “Hallo, Hewitt! you’ve been and got shut of your Softy,” thelandlord did not like it. Softy as Gervase was, to have got him thusfast in the web, old Sir Giles’ only son, was a kind of triumph to thehouse.In the afternoon, however, Patty resolved to take a walk. It was anindulgence which she permitted to herself periodically--that her bestthings and her hat with the roses, her light gloves and her parasolmight not spoil for want of use. She put on all this finery, however,with a sinking at her heart. The last time she had worn them she hadbeen all in a thrill with excitement, bent upon the boldest step she hadever taken in her life. And the high tension of her nerves and passionof her mind had been increased by the unexpected colloquy with LadyPiercey at the carriage-door. But that was a day of triumph all alongthe line. She had baffled the old lady, and she had roused her own auntto a fierce enthusiasm of interest, which had reacted upon herself andincreased her determination, and the fervour of her own. When she hadwalked back that evening with the fifty pounds, she had felt herselfalready my lady, uplifted to a pinnacle of grandeur from which nofathers or mothers could bring her down. But now! Gervase himself hadnot seemed a very important part of that triumph a little while ago. Hehad been a chattel of hers, a piece of property as much her own as herparasol. And if he had emancipated himself, if he had escaped out of hernet, if his mother had obtained the mastery of him, or sent him away,Patty felt as if she must die of rage and humiliation. To take back thatfifty pounds to Aunt Patience and allow that the use she had got it forwas no longer possible; to submit to be asked on all sides, by Roger intriumph, by everybody else in scorn, what had become of him? was morethan she could bear. She would rather run away and go to service inLondon. She would rather---- there was nothing in the world that Pattydid not feel herself capable of doing rather than bear the brunt of thisdisappointment and shame.It must be added that the value of Gervase individually was enormouslyenhanced by this period of doubt and alarm. The prize that is on thepoint of being lost is very different from that which falls naturally,easily into your hands. Patty thought of the Softy no longer as if hewere a piece of still life; no more--indeed, not so much--a part of theproceedings which were to end eventually in making her my lady as themarriage-licence which would cost such a deal of money. All that waschanged now. Poor fellow! he who had never been of much importance toanybody had become of the very greatest consequence now. She wouldnever, never be my lady at all, unless he took a principal part init--the great fool, the goose, the gaby! But though her feelings brokeout once or twice in a string of such reproaches under her breath,Gervase was too important a factor now to be thought of or addressed bycontemptuous epithets. He could spoil it all; he could make all herpreparations useless. He could shame her in the eyes of Aunt Patience,and even before the whole of her little world, although nobody knew howfar things had gone. Therefore it was with an anxious heart that Pattymade a turn round by the outskirts of the village as if she were goingto pay a visit to her Aunt Patience--the last place in the world whereshe desired to go--and then directed her steps towards the Manor,meaning to make a wide round past the iron gate and the beech-treeavenue, which were visible to any passenger walking across the downs.She gave a long look, as she passed, at the great house, with all itswindows twinkling in the afternoon sun, and the two long processions oftrees on either side. Her heart rose to her mouth at the thought thatall this might, yet might never, be her own. Might be! it had seemedcertain a week ago; and yet might never be if that fool--oh, thatimbecile, that ridiculous, vacant, gaping Softy--should take it into hisfoolish head to draw back now.The road lay close under the wall of the park beyond the iron gate.Patty had got so anxious, so terrified, so horribly convinced that herchances of meeting him were small, and that, except in an accidentalway, she could not hope to lay hands on him again, that her stout heartalmost failed her as she went on. It was a very warm day, and she wasflushed and heated with her walk, as well as with the suspense and alarmof which her mind was full, so that she was aware she was not lookingher best, when suddenly, without warning, she came full upon him roundthe corner, almost striking him with her outstretched parasol in thesuddenness of the encounter. Gervase did not see her at all. He wascoming on with his head bent, his under-lip hanging, his hands in hispockets, busy with his old game--six white ones all in a heap. What ajump for the right-hand man! and hallo, hallo! a little brown fellowslipping along on the other side, driven by somebody’s foot! He made amental note of that before looking to see who the somebody was, whichwas of so much less importance. And then Patty’s little cry of surpriseand “Oh! Mr. Gervase!” went through him like a shot at his ear. He gavea shout like the inarticulate delight of a dog, and flew towards her asif he had been Dash or Rover, roused by the ecstatic sound of theirmaster’s voice.“Patty! Lord, to think of you being here! and me, that hasn’t had apeep of you for a whole week. Patty! Oh, come now, I can’t help it. I’mso happy, I could eat you up. Patty, Patty!” cried the poor fellow,patting her on the shoulder, looking into her face with his dull eyessuddenly inspired, “you’re sure it’s you!”“And a deal you care whether it’s me or not, Mr. Gervase,” cried Patty,tossing her head. But in that moment Patty had become herself again. Heranxiety was over, her bosom’s lord sat lightly on his throne. The fiftypounds in the little bag no longer felt like a blister. She was themistress of the situation, and all her troubled thoughts flew before thewind as if they had never been.“A deal I care? Oh, I do care a deal, Patty, if you only knew! Never youdo it again--to make me stay away like this. I’ve made a mull of it, asI knew I should, without you to back me up. Father turns his back on me.He won’t say a word. And even mother, that was always my stand-by, shesays she can’t abide to see me there.”Again Gervase looked as if he would cry; but brightening up suddenly, “Idon’t mind a bit as long as I can see you, and you’ll tell me what todo.”“Well,” said Patty, “I could perhaps tell you if I knew what you wantedto do. But I can’t stand still here, for I’ve come out for a walk, andif you wish to speak to me you must come along with me. I’m going as faras Carter’s Wells, and the afternoon’s wearing on.”“Oh!” said Gervase, discomfited, “you’re going as far as Carter’s Wells?I thought--I supposed--or I wanted to think, Patty--as you were comingto look for me!”“What should I do that for, Mr. Gervase?” said Patty, demurely.“I’m sure I don’t know,” said the poor Softy. “I just thought so. Youmight have had something you wanted to tell me, or--to say I might comeback, or----”“What should I have to tell you, Mr. Gervase?”He looked piteously at her, all astray, and took off his cap, andpushed his fingers through his hair. “I’m sure I don’t know; and yetthere was something that I wanted badly to hear. Patty, don’t you make afool of me like all the rest! If I don’t know what it is, having such adreadful memory, you do.”“It’s a wonder as you remembered me at all, Mr. Gervase,” said Patty,giving him a little sting in passing.“You! I’d never forget you if I lived to be a hundred. I’d forget myselfsooner, far sooner, than I’d forget you.”“But it’s a long time since you’ve seen me, and you’ve forgotten all youwanted of me,” Patty said, with a sharp tone of curiosity in her voice.“No, I don’t forget; I do know what I want--I want to marry you, Patty.I’ve been obeying all your orders, and trying to please the old folksfor nothing but that. But it don’t seem to succeed, somehow,” he said,shaking his head; “somehow it don’t seem to succeed.”“They will never give their consent to that, Mr. Gervase!”“No?” he said, doubtfully. “Well, of course you must be right, Patty.They don’t seem to like it when I tell them it’s because of you I’mtrying to please them and staying like this at home.”“You should never have said that,” she cried quickly; “you should havemade them think it was all because you were so fond of them, and likedbest being at home.”“But it would be a lie,” said Gervase, simply, “and mother’s awfulsharp; she always finds out when you tell her a crammer. Say I may cometo-night; do now, Patty,--I can’t bear it any more.”“But you must bear it, Mr. Gervase,” said Patty; “that is, if youreally, really, want _that_ to come true.”“What’s that, Patty?” cried the young man.“Oh, you----!”--it was only a breath, and ended in nothing. Patty sawthat mincing matters was of no use. “I mean about us being married,” shesaid, turning her head away.“If I want it!” he cried, “when you know there is nothing in the worldI want but that. Nobody would ever put upon me if I had only you tostand by me, Patty. Tell me what I am to do.”She unfolded her scheme to him after this with little hesitation. He wasto continue his attendance at home for a little longer, and to propoundto his parents his desire to go to London and see the fine sights there.It took Patty a considerable time to put all this into her lover’shead--what he was to say, which she repeated over to him several times;and what he was to do afterwards, and the extreme importance of notforgetting, of never mentioning her nor the Seven Thorns, nor anythingthat could recall her to their minds. He was to say that the country wasdull (“And so it is--especially at home, and when I can’t see you,” saidGervase), and that he had never seen London since he was a child, and itwas a shame he never was trusted to go anywhere or see anything. (“Andso it is a great shame.”) When all this was well grafted into his mind,or, at least Patty hoped so, she announced that she had changed herintention and would go no more to Carter’s Wells, but straight home tocomplete her preparations. And he was allowed to accompany her backalmost as far as the high road, then dismissed to return home anotherway. Patty did not say that she was afraid of meeting Lady Piercey’scarriage; but this was in her mind as she proceeded towards the SevenThorns, with her head and her parasol high, like an army with banners,not at all afraid now, rather wishing for that encounter. It did takeplace according to her prevision when she was almost in sight of thegroup of stunted and aged trees which gave their name to her father’shouse. Why Lady Piercey should be passing that way, she herself,perhaps, could scarcely have told. She wanted, it might be, with thatattraction of dislike which is as strong as love, to see again the girlwho had so much power over Gervase, and of whom he said in his fatuousway, that it was she who was the occasion of his present home-keepingmood; or she wanted, as the angry and suspicious mind always hopes todo, to “catch” Patty and be able to report some flirtation or maliciousanecdote of her in the hearing of Gervase. The old lady had strained herneck looking back at the Seven Thorns, which lay all vacant in thewestering sunshine, the door open and void, nobody on the outside bench,nobody at the window--a perfectly harmless uninteresting house, piquingthe curiosity more than if there had been people about. “I declare,Meg,” Lady Piercey was saying, “that horrid house gets emptier andpoorer every day. The man must be going all to ruin, with not so much asa tramp to call for a glass of beer; and serves him right, to bring upthat daughter as he has, all show and finery, and good for nothing aboutsuch a place.” “The Rector has a great opinion of her,” said Margaret;“they say she is so active and such a good manager.” “Oh! stuff andnonsense,” cried Lady Piercey, “you saw her with your own eyes in lightgloves and a parasol, trailing her gown along the road; a girl out of abeershop, a girl----” But here Lady Piercey stopped short with a gasp,for close to the side of the carriage, and almost within hearing, wasthe same resplendent figure; the hat nodding with its roses; the gown alittle too long, and trailing, as was the absurd fashion of that time;the light gloves firmly grasping the parasol, which was held high likean ensign, leaving the girl’s determined and triumphant face fullyvisible. Patty marched past, giving but one glance to the inmates of thecarriage, her colour high and her attitude martial; while the great ladyalmost fell back upon her cushions, overwhelmed with the suddenness ofthe encounter. Fortunately Lady Piercey did not see the tremendous nudgewhich John on the box gave to the coachman. She was too much moved bythis startling incident to note any other demonstration of feeling.“Did you see that?” she asked in a low tone, almost with awe, when thatapparition had passed.“Yes--I saw her. She is too fine for her station, but Aunt----”“Don’t put any of your buts to me, Meg! Do you think she could hear whatwe were saying? The bold, brazen creature! passing me by without a bendof her knee, as if she were as good as we are. What is this world comingto when a girl bred up in my own school, in my own parish, that hasdropped curtseys to me since ever she was a baby, should dare to pass meby like that?” Lady Piercey, who had grown very red in sudden passion,now grew pale with horror at a state of affairs so terrible. “She lookedas if she felt herself the lady, and us nobodies. Meg! do you thinkGervase has it in him to marry that girl, and give her my name when youruncle dies! If I thought that, I think it would kill me! at least,” shecried, sitting up with fire in her watery eyes--“it would put me on mymettle, and I’d mince matters no more, but get the doctor’s advice andlock him up.”“My uncle would never consent to that.”“Your uncle---- would just do what I wish. There’s not many things he’sever crossed me in; and all he has have turned out badly. If I couldmake up my mind to it, it wouldn’t be your uncle that would stop me. Ihave a great mind to send for the doctor to-night.”“But Aunt, is it not more likely they have quarrelled,” said Margaret,“since he has been staying at home so faithfully, and never been absentday or night?”“Do you think that’s it, Meg? or do you think it’s only policy to throwdust in our eyes? Oh, I wish I knew. I wish I knew. Oh, Meg, that Ishould say it! I feel as if I’d rather he should go out even to thathorrible Seven Thorns, than drive us all frantic with staying at home.If he goes on like that another night, I don’t think I can bear it. Oh,it’s all very well for you, sitting patient and smiling! If you were tosee your only child sitting there like an idiot, and showing the verypage-boy what a fool he is, and gabbling and grinning till you canhardly endure yourself, I wonder--I wonder what you’d say.”CHAPTER XII.Gervase went home still with his head bent, but no longer thinking ofthe white pebbles and the brown. It is true that his accustomed eyecaught a big one here and there, which had rolled to the side of thepath, and which he felt with regret would have come in so finely for theright or the left-hand man! but his mind was fixed on his _consigne_,and he was saying to himself over and over the words Patty had taughthim--that he wanted to go to see London, and all the fine things there;that he was tired (mortal tired) of staying always at home; that it wasa shame he never was trusted nor allowed to do anything (and so it was ashame). He could not even think of the pleasure of going to London, ofmeeting Patty at the station, and all that was to follow, so absorbedwere his thoughts with what he had to say in the meantime. And it wouldnot have been surprising had Gervase been overwhelmed by the thought ofmaking such a wild suggestion to his parents, who had kept him hithertolike a child under their constant supervision. But his simple mind wasnot troubled by any such reflection as this. Patty had told him what tosay, and no feeling of the impossibility of the thing, or of the strangedeparture in it from all the rules which had guided his life, affectedhim. If it did not succeed, all he had to do was to tell her, and shewould think of something else. Better heads than that of poor Gervasehave found this a great relief among the problems of life. As for him,he was not aware of any problems; he had a thing to say, and the troublewas lest he should forget it or say it wrong. To think of anythingfurther was not his share of the business. He, too, met his mother justas she returned from her drive, so that he had taken a considerable timeto that exercise, walking up and down the path that led under the wallof the park, conning his lesson. An impulse came upon him to say it offthen and there, and so free his mind from the responsibility; but heremembered in time that Patty had said it was to be kept till afterdinner, when his father and mother were both present. He was ratherfrightened, however, when the carriage suddenly drove up, and he wascalled to the door. “Hallo! mamma,” he said, striding over a gorse bushthat was in his way. Lady Piercey had jumped at the conclusion, as soonas she saw him, that there had been a meeting, as she said, “betweenthose two.” She called out quickly to take him by surprise, “Hi!Gervase! have you met anybody on the road?”Now, Gervase was not clever, as the reader knows; but just because hewas a Softy, and his brains different from other people’s, he was betterqualified to deal with such a question than a more intelligent youthmight have been. “Met anybody on the road?” he said, gazing with hisdull eyes and open mouth. “But I’ve not been on the road; I’ve only beenup and down here.”“Oh, you----! but here is just the same as the road. Who have you beentalking to?” the mother cried.“There was the man with the donkey from Carter’s Wells,” said Gervase;“but I never said a word to him, nor he didn’t to me.”“Was that the only person you saw? Tell me the truth,” said Lady Pierceyseverely. Gervase put his head on one side, and seemed to reflect.“If I’m to tell the dead truth,” he said, “but I don’t want to, mother,for you’ll scold like old boots----”“Tell me this instant!” cried Lady Piercey, red already with the ragethat was ready to burst forth.“Well, then, there just was--the ratcatcher with his pockets full offerrets coming up from----”“Home!” cried the lady, more angry than words could say. “Oh, you fool!”she said, shaking her fist at her son, who stood laughing, his moistlips glistening--no very pleasant sight for a mother’s eye.“I thought I was to tell you the truth,” he cried after them, as thecarriage whirled away.“Do you think it was the truth, Meg?” Lady Piercey demanded, in a gasp,when they had swept into the avenue. A feeling of relief came as heranger quieted down.“Dear Aunt--do you think he could invent so quickly, without any time toprepare?”“You mean he couldn’t because he’s not clever? Heaven knows! They’re asdeep as the deep sea, and as cunning as----. But that ratcatcher is aman I will not have hanging, with those beasts in his pockets, about myhouse.”The ratcatcher gave occasion for a good deal of talk that afternoon,both in Gervase’s presence and out of it; and by good luck he had beenabout, and Lady Piercey gave her orders as to his expulsion from thepremises, whenever he should appear, with real satisfaction. “He’s notcompany for Gervase, and that every one knows,” she said at the dinnertable, when old Sir Giles ventured to remonstrate on behalf of theferrets and their owner.“Mother always says that when it’s any fellow I like to have a chatwith,” Gervase said.“There’s no harm in old Jerry,” said Sir Giles. “A man shouldn’t be toosqueamish, my lady. A good-natured word here and there is what’s wantedof a country squire.”“But not taking pleasure in low company,” retorted Lady Piercey. “And Itell you again, I won’t have that old wretch and his beasts about myhouse.”“But father knows it’s rare fun sometimes, ain’t it, father?” said theyoung man, kicking the old gentleman under the table. Fortunately, thekick touched only Sir Giles’ stick, and he was not displeased to takeGervase’s part for once against his wife.“Hush, you young ass, can’t you? We don’t speak of these things beforeladies,” he said.This little confidential aside put Sir Giles in good humour. But whenthe family retired into the library, which was done by no means in theusual order--for Sir Giles himself in his chair, wheeled by Dunning, ledthe way--it was evident that an uneasy alarm in respect to Gervase wasthe leading sentiment in everybody’s mind. Sir Giles announced loudlythat it was Dunning, and only Dunning, who should play with himto-night. “I’ve got to give the fellow his revenge,” he said. “I beathim black and blue last night. Eh, Dunning, didn’t I beat you black andblue? You’re not a bad player, but not just up to my strength.”“No, Sir Giles,” answered the man, setting the table in haste, andkeeping carefully between it and the heir of the house. Lady Piercey, onher side, employed Parsons and Margaret, both of whom were inattendance, in covering up all her silks. “Put them in the basket,” shesaid, “and take out one as I want it. That’s always the best way.” Thusdefended, the parents kept a furtive watch upon the movements of theirson, but with less alarm than before, while Lady Piercey kept on arunning exhortation to Mrs. Osborne in an undertone. “Meg! get him toplay something. Meg! why don’t you take him in hand! Meg! the boy’s sureto get into mischief for want of something to do.”“Should you like a game of cribbage, Gervase?” said poor Margaret,unable to resist the urgency of this appeal.“Cribbage is the old-fashionedest game; they don’t play itanywhere--even in the publics,” said Gervase. He had put himself in thefavourite attitude of Englishmen, with his back to the fireplace; hiscoat-tails gathered over his arms in faithful adherence to custom,though the cause for any such unseemly custom was not there.“Or bézique?” said Margaret; “or perhaps you’ll sing a song, Gervase, ifI play it. Your mother would like to hear you sing: you haven’t sung hera song for years.”“Do, Gervase, there’s a dear,” said Lady Piercey. “You used to sing ‘Thenorth winds do blow, and we shall have snow,’ so pretty when you werequite a little thing.”“I ain’t a little thing now, and I’m not going to sing,” said Gervaseloudly. “I’m going to say something to father and mother. You can goaway, Meg, if you don’t want to hear.”“What is it?” cried Lady Piercey, sitting up more bolt-upright thanusual, and taking off her spectacles to see him the better, and to cowhim with the blaze of her angry eyes.“This is what it is,” said Gervase. “It’s mortal dull at home, now thatI’ve turned over a new leaf and don’t go out anywhere at night; and afellow of my age wants a little diversion, and I can’t go on sitting inyour pocket, mother, nor playing father’s game every night--and he don’tlike losing, neither, and no more don’t I.”This preamble was quite new, struck off out of his own head from Patty’stext. It was with a great elation and rising self-confidence thatGervase found it so. Perhaps they’d find out that he was not such a foolas he looked--once he had got free.“Eh! what’s the lad saying? That’s true enough--that’s true enough,” SirGiles said.“Oh, hold your tongue, papa! You don’t know what he’s aiming at,” LadyPiercey said.“And I’ve never seen a thing, nor gone any-place,” said Gervase. “Itsd---- d hard upon me--it’s devilish hard. Oh,” he cried, “I can speak upwhen I like! It’s that dull nobody would stand it (and so it is).” Headded his old parentheses, though he had dropped the original theme. “Imustn’t talk a moment with any person, but mother’s down upon me--evenJerry, the ratcatcher, that every one knows.”“That’s true, my boy,” cried Sir Giles, “your mother’s too hard on you;that’s quite true.”“Wait, you fool, till you know what he’s aiming at,” cried Lady Piercey,with her eyes on fire.“And I can’t play your game, father, nor take you for a walk, butthere’s a fright all round as if I was going to kill you; and oldDunning after me, looking like a stuck pig.”Here was a chance for Lady Piercey to approve, too, at her husband’sexpense; but she was magnanimous, and did not take it. “You’re wellmeaning enough, Gervase,” she said, “I don’t deny it; but you’re toostrong, and you shake poor papa to bits.”“Well, then,” said Gervase, raising his voice to talk her down, “it’sclear as there is nothing here for me to do; and it’s dreadful dull.Enough to kill a man of my age; and the short and the long of it is thatI can’t go on like this any more.”He had quite thrown Patty’s carefully prepared speech away, and yet itcame breathing over him by turns, checking his natural eloquence. Shehad never meant him to utter that outcry of impatience, and Gervasewould have ruined his own cause, and gone on to say, “I am going to bemarried,” but for the questions that were suddenly showered upon him,driving him back upon his lesson.“You can’t go on like this? And how are you going on?” cried his mother.“Everything a man can desire, and the best home in England, andconsidered in every way!” She went on speaking, but her voice wascrossed by old Sir Giles’ growl. “What do you want--what do you want?”cried the old man. “Dunning, be off to your supper, and take that womanwith you. What do you want--what do you want, you young fool?”“But I know what you want,” Lady Piercey cried, becoming audible at theend of this interruption; “you want what you shall never have as long asI live, unless it’s somebody of my choosing, and not of yours.”“I’ll tell you what I want,” said Gervase, the moisture flying from hismouth; “I want to have a---- I want to get---- I want P----.” Then thatlong-conned speech of Patty’s flew suddenly, like a cobweb, into hismind, and stopped him on the edge of the abyss. He stopped and stared atthem for a moment, his eyes roaming round the room, and then he burstinto a loud laugh. “I want to go to London,” he said, “and see all thefine things there. I don’t know what mother’s got in her head--some ofher whimseys--I’ve never been let go anywhere or do anything, and I wantto go to London to look about and see all the grand things there.”“To London?” said Sir Giles with surprise. Lady Piercey had been woundup to too great a pitch to go easily down again. She opened her mouthwith a gasp like a fish, but no sound came therefrom.“I’ve never been let go anywhere,” said Gervase, “and up and down fromthe Manor to the village ain’t enough. I want to go to London and seethe fine sights there; I want to see the Queen and all that; I want tosee a bit of life. There never was a gentleman like me that was kept soclose and never let go to see anything. I’ve not been in London since Iwas a little kid, and it is a shame that I am never trusted (so it is),and it’s mortal dull here, especially at home, and not seeing anything;and I want to go to London and see a bit of life, and not be buriedalive here.”“My lady,” said Sir Giles, after the pause of awe which followed thislong, consequent, and coherent speech, “there’s reason in what the ladsays.”“There’s something underneath,” cried Lady Piercey, “a deal more thanwhat he says.”“Mother always thinks that,” cried Gervase, with his big laugh; andthere could not be any question that what he said was true.“There’s some plan underneath it all,” repeated Lady Piercey, strikingher hand on the table. “He hasn’t the sense to make up a thing likethat, that has reason in it; there’s some deep-laid plan underneath itall.”“Pooh, my lady! Poor lad!” said Sir Giles, shaking his head; “he hasn’tthe sense to make up a plan at all. He just says what comes into hishead, and what he says has reason in it, and more than that, I’m glad tohear him say it. And it gives me a bit of hope,” said poor old SirGiles, his voice shaking a little, “that when he comes fully to man’sestate, the boy, poor lad, will be more like other boys, Mary Ann, Godbless him! and, perhaps, for so little as we think it, a real comfort toyou and me.”The old gentleman leaned back in his chair, and raised with a feeblehand his handkerchief to his eyes. It was not difficult nowadays to makeSir Giles cry. The fierce old lady had no such emotion to subdue. Shesat very upright, staring at her son, suspicious, thinking she sawbehind him the pert little defiant countenance under the parasol whichshe had met on the road. But she did not see how they could have met orcommunicated with each other, and she could not, on the spur of themoment, make out what connection there could be between his desire to goto London, and Patty of the Seven Thorns. Margaret stood behind heruncle’s chair, patting him softly on the shoulder to soothe him andassure him of sympathy. She looked over Sir Giles’ head at the boy who,he was able to flatter himself, might be like other boys when he came toman’s estate. How strangely can love and weakness be deceived! Gervasestood there against the mantelpiece, his foot caught up awkwardly in hishand, his slouching shoulders supported against the shelf, his big,loose bulk filling the place. Man’s estate! The poor Softy waseight-and-twenty and well grown, though he slouched and distortedhimself. But still the father, and even the suspicious, less-persuadablemother, saw in him a boy, not beyond the season of growth--never beyondthat of hope.Fortunately for Gervase, he had not time to go on in his flush oftriumph and success, for another moment of that elation might havebroken down all precautions and betrayed the plan which his mother felt,but could not divine, underneath. In the meantime, however, it wasbedtime, and neither Sir Giles nor my lady could bear any more. LadyPiercey sent off Parsons, and discussed the question with her niece inher bedroom for a full hour after. “There’s something underneath, I knowthere is,” Lady Piercey said, nodding her head in her big nightcap. “ButI don’t see what she can have to do with it, for she would never want tosend him away. And then, on the other hand, Meg, it would be the bestthing in the world to send him away. There’s nothing like absence forblowing a thing like that out of a boy’s head. If there was a man wecould trust to go with him,--but all alone, by himself, in a big placelike London, and among so many temptations! Oh, Meg, Meg, I wish I knewwhat was the right thing to do!”“He is very innocent, Aunt; he would not understand the temptation,”said Margaret.“Oh, I’m not of that opinion at all,” cried Lady Piercey. “A man alwaysunderstands that, however silly he may be; and sometimes, the sillier heis, the more he understands. But one nail knocks out another,” sheadded thoughtfully. Though Lady Piercey was not a woman of the world,but only a very rustic person, she was yet cynic enough for theremorseless calculation that a little backsliding, of which so manypeople were guilty, would be better than a dreadful marriage which wouldbring down the family, and corrupt the very race--which was her point ofview.Gervase roamed about the house in high excitement, immensely pleasedwith himself, while this colloquy was going on. Had he met even Dunningor Parsons, whom he did not love, the possibility was that he might haverevealed his meaning to them in sheer elation of spirits. But neither ofthese persons came in his way, and in this early household most of theother servants were already in bed. Margaret, however, met him as usualwhen she came out of Lady Piercey’s room with her candle in her hand.“What’s she been saying to you, Meg?” he asked, but burst out laughingbefore she could reply. “It’s such a joke,” he said, holding his sides,“such a joke, if you only knew! and I’ve half a mind to tell you, Meg,for you’re a good sort.”“Don’t tell me anything, Gervase, for Heaven’s sake, that I can’t tellthem. For, of course, I shall do so directly,” Margaret cried.“Wouldn’t you just like to know?” he said, and laughed again, andchucked her under the chin in convulsions of hilarity. She stood at thedoor of the room, escaping hastily from the possible confidence and thefamiliarity, and, trembling, saw him slide down the banisters to thehalf-lighted hall below, with a childish chuckle of triumph. A slip uponthat swift descent, and all might have been over--the commotion and theexultation, the trouble and the fear. But Gervase came back againbeaming, and kissed his hand to her as he disappeared into his own room.He felt that he had gained the day.CHAPTER XIII.The household at Greyshott was much disturbed and excited by the newidea thus thrown into the midst of them. Lady Piercey discussed it allnext morning, not only with Margaret but with Parsons, whose views onthe subject were very decided. She thought, but this within herself,that to get quit of the Softy, even for a few days, would be a greatblessing to the house--though what she said was chiefly to agree withher mistress that a change, and to see a little of life, would be thebest thing possible for Mr. Gervase.“’Tisn’t good for any young man to be always at home,” said LadyPiercey. “I remember a piece of poetry, or a hymn, or something, which Iused to know, that had a line about home-keeping youths, and that theyhad but poor wits--that is, looked as if they had poor wits, becausethey had never seen anything, don’t you know?”“Yes, my lady,” said Parsons; “that’s just how it is.”“And the dear boy has come to feel it himself,” continued the mother;“he sees all the rest of the young men rushing about from one end of theworld to the other, and he’s begun to ask himself, How’s that? Don’t yousee, Parsons?”“Yes, my lady, it’s as plain as the eyes in one’s head,” said Parsons.“Of course, it is all because of his being so delicate when he was achild,” said the old lady.“But what a blessing it is, my lady, to see how he’s outgrown it now!”“Yes, isn’t it a blessing, Parsons! Just as strong as any of them--andwell grown--a good height, and large round the chest, and all that.”“Yes, my lady,” Parsons replied. She did not commit herself, but shechimed in most satisfactorily with all that her lady said.Margaret was by no means so entirely to be trusted to. She was verydoubtful of the proposed expedition, and even when she assented, as itwas often necessary to do to what her aunt said, did so with souncertain and troubled a look that Lady Piercey, by force of theopposition, was more and more rooted in her view.“It would do him all the good in the world,” she said. “I know you thinkhe’s silly, my poor boy--not that he’s really silly, not a bit; but hedoes not know how to express himself; and how is he ever to learn, stuckup here at home between you and me and his poor father, Meg?”Margaret was a little taken aback by this question, and in her confusionlaughed inadvertently, which made Lady Piercey very angry.“You think you are clever enough for anything, and could teach him--aswell as the best!”“No, indeed,” cried Margaret; “not at all. I don’t know how young menlearn---- to express themselves. I think, so far as I have seen, thatthere are a great many who know how to express themselves---- much worsethan Gervase,” she added hastily; for after all, it was not poorGervase’s fault, whereas it was the fault of many other men.The mother, in her jealousy for her son, was pacified by this, and shookher head. “Oh, yes,” she said, “there are many of them that are a poorlot. Gervase is---- one in ten thousand, Meg. He is a gentleman, my poorboy. He doesn’t know how to bully or make himself disagreeable. You knowI am saying no more than the truth. He would do far better in the worldif he made more of himself.”This required from Margaret only a murmur of assent--which she gavewithout too much strain of conscience; but she was unprepared for theswift following up of this concession. “So it’s your opinion, Meg--ifyour opinion were asked, which I don’t think likely--that your uncle andI should let him go?”“Let him go! But as you say, aunt, my opinion is not likely to beasked,” Margaret said quickly, to cover her exclamation of dismay.“I’m not too fond of asking anybody’s opinion. I like to hear what theysay, just to make sure of my own; but since you’ve given yours, as yougenerally do, without waiting to be asked,--and you’re not so far wrongas usual this time,--he ought to have his freedom. He’s never doneanything to make us suppose that he wouldn’t use it rightly. He is a boyin a thousand, Meg! He has no bad ways--he is only too innocent,suspecting nobody.”“That might be the danger,” said Margaret.“Yes, my dear, that is just the thing--you have hit it, though you arenot so bright as you think. He suspects nobody. He would put his moneyor whatever he had into anybody’s hands. He thinks every one is asinnocent as himself.”It would have been hard upon the poor mother had Margaret said what shethought: that Gervase did not think at all, which was a danger greaterstill. Lady Piercey knew all there was to be said on that point, and shekept her eye upon her niece, waiting to surprise that judgment in herface. Oh, she knew very well not only all that could be said, but allthe reason there was for saying it! Lady Piercey was not deceived on thesubject of her son, nor unaware of any of his deficiencies. It is to besupposed, knowing all these, that she must have known the dangers towhich he must be exposed if he were allowed to carry out this proposal;but many other things were working in her mind. She thought it was onlyjust that he should see life; and she thought, cynically, with a woman’shalf-knowledge, half-suspicion of what that meant--that life as seen inLondon would cure him entirely of Patty and of the dangers that wereconcentrated in her. Finally, there was a dreadful relief in the thoughtof getting rid of him for a little while, of being exempt, if even for afew days, from his presence, when he was present, which wasinsupportable--and from the anxiety about his home-coming and where hewas, when he was absent. The thought of having him comfortably out ofsight for a time, so far off that she should be no longer responsiblefor him, even to herself; that she should no longer require to watch andwait for him, but could go to bed when she pleased, independent of thequestion whether Gervase had come home--that prospect attracted hermore than words could say. Oh, the rest and refreshment it would be!the exemption from care, the repose of mind! Whatever he might do inLondon, she, at least, would not see it. Young men, when they wereseeing life, did not generally conduct themselves to the satisfaction oftheir parents. They acted after their kind, and nobody was very hardupon them. Gervase would be just like the others--just like others!which was what he had never been hitherto, what she had always wishedand longed for him to be. She sat for a long time at her embroidery,silent, working her mouth as she did when she was turning over any greatquestion in her mind; and Margaret was too glad to respect her aunt’sabstraction, to leave her at full liberty to think. At length LadyPiercey suddenly threw down her needle, and with a gesture more like aman than an old lady, smote her knee with her hand.“I’ve got it!” she cried. “I’ve found just the right thing to do!”Parsons stopped and listened at the other end of the room, and Margaretpaused in her work too, and raised her eyes. Lady Piercey’s countenancewas in a flush of pleasure; she went on drumming on her knee inexcitement, swaying a little back and forward in her chair.“It is the very thing,” she said. “He’ll get his freedom, and yet he’llbe well looked after. You remember Dr. Gregson, him that was at thatpoor little dingy chapel when we were in town? Oh! you never rememberanything, Meg! Parsons, you recollect Dr. Gregson, the clergyman withthe family--that was so poor?”“Yes, my lady,” said Parsons, coming a few steps nearer; her presencemade legitimate, even during the discussion of these family matters, bythis demand.“Oh, you needn’t stop work; I am talking to my niece. When I want youI’ll call you,” said Lady Piercey, ruthless, waving her away. “Meg,” shesaid, after watching the woman’s reluctant withdrawal, “servants are apretty set, poking their heads into everything; but you always stand upfor them. Perhaps you think I’d better have up the cook, and let thewhole of ’em know?”“No; if you ask my opinion, Aunt, I think they are better left out.”“Oh, you think they are better left out? Perhaps you think I’d betterkeep it all in my own mind, and not speak of my affairs at all? But itdoesn’t matter much, and that’s a satisfaction, what you think,” saidLady Piercey, grimly. Then she resumed the argument. “I see my way; Isee how we can do it all! Mr. Gregson is as poor as a church mouse, andhe’ll do anything to get a little money. He shall meet Gervase at thestation, and he shall look after him and show him life, as the poor boysays.” She laughed a low, reverberating laugh, that seemed to roll roundthe room; and then she added, giving Mrs. Osborne a push with her elbow,“You don’t seem to see the fun of it, Meg.”“I don’t think Gervase will; nor, perhaps, the poor clergyman.”The old lady laughed with deep enjoyment, putting one hand on her side.“Gregson will like anything that puts a little money in his pocket. Andas for Gervase----” It was some utterance of deep contempt that was onLady Piercey’s lips; but she remembered herself, and repressed it intime. During the rest of the morning she sat almost silent, with hermouth working, and, as if she were turning over an amusing thought,gave vent now and then to a chuckle of laughter. The idea of sendingGervase to see life under the auspices of the poor little Low Churchincumbent of Drummond Chapel, Bloomsbury, was delightful. She felt herown cleverness in having thought of it almost as much as she felt thehappy relief of being thus rid of her poor Softy without any harm--nay,with perfect safety to him. All the accessories were delightful--theastonishment of Dr. Gregson, the ludicrous disappointment of the weakyoung man, his probable seduction into tea-parties and Bible-classes,which would be much more wholesome for him than the other way of seeinglife. It occurred to Lady Piercey, with a momentary check upon hertriumph, that there had been little girls among the Gregsons who mighthave grown up into dangerous young persons by this time. But that gaveher but a temporary alarm, for, to be sure, it would be easy enough todrop any entanglement of that kind, and a young Gregson might, in themost virtuous manner, supplant Patty, as well as the worst--and allwould consequently work for good to the only person of any consequence,the only son and heir of Sir Giles Piercey, of Greyshott, for whom alonehis mother was concerned.When this brilliant idea was communicated to Sir Giles, he, too, smotehis thigh and burst into such a roar of laughter, that notwithstandingher gratification in the success of this admirable practical joke ofhers, Lady Piercey was afraid. He laughed till he was red, or rathercrimson, with a tinge of blue in the face; his large, helpless frameheaving with the roar which resounded through the room. She was sofrightened that she summoned Dunning hastily, though she had the momentbefore sent him away, and had entered her husband’s room alone, withoutany attendant on her own side, to consult him on this all-importantsubject. When Dunning returned, triumphant in the sense that they couldnot do without him, and tingling with curiosity, which he never doubtedhe should now have abundant means of satisfying, he found Sir Giles in aspasmodic condition in his chair, laughing by intervals, while LadyPiercey stood by his side, patting him upon the back with unaccustomedhands, and saying, “Now, my dear; now, now, my dear,” as she might havedone to a restive horse. Sir Giles’ exuberance faded away at the sightof Dunning, who knew exactly what to do to make him, as they said,comfortable. And thus it happened that this old pair, who were olderthan the parents of Gervase had any need to be, and looked, both, mucholder than they were, from illness and self-indulgence, and all itsattendant infirmities--were left to consult upon the fate of their onlychild with the servant making a third, which was very galling to LadyPiercey’s pride. Sir Giles did not pay any attention. Dunning was to himnot a man, but a sort of accessory--a thing that did not count. Hecalmed down out of his paroxysms of laughter at Dunning’s appearance,but still kept bursting out at intervals. “What if the fellow”--and thenhe stopped to cough and laugh again--“what if he falls in love with MissBrown or Miss Jones?” he said. “And then, my lady, you would be out ofthe frying-pan into the fire.”“I am not afraid of Miss Smith or Miss Jones,” she cried, making a signto him over Dunning’s head to be careful what he said. But Sir Giles wasin the humour for speech, and cared nothing who was present.“I think a deal of these ladies,” he said, in his mumbling voice. “It’sa great joke--a great joke. I should like to see old Gregson’s face whenhe hears of it. By Jove! and the old plotter you are, my lady, to makeit all up. But it can’t be; it can’t be.”“Why can’t it be?” cried Lady Piercey sharply, and much provoked.“Because it wouldn’t be fair, neither to the one of them nor to theother. Not fair at all, by George. Fair play’s a jewel. What are youafter, Dunning? Let my legs alone. There’s nothing the matter with mylegs. And you can go and be dashed to you. Can’t I talk to my ladywithout you here?”“Don’t send him away,” cried Lady Piercey hurriedly. “I can’t have youget ill, and perhaps do yourself harm, because of me.”“Do myself fiddlesticks,” cried Sir Giles. “I’m as strong as a horse,ain’t I, Dunning? Be off with you, be off with you; don’t you hear? I’llthrow my stick at you if you don’t scuttle, you son of a----. Hey! youcan tell my lady I’m as well as either you or she.”“Yes, Sir Giles,” said Dunning, stolid and calm. But he did not go away.“It wouldn’t be fair,” Sir Giles went on, forgetting what he had said.“I say fair play all the world over. Women don’t understand it. It’s acapital joke, and I didn’t think you had so much fun in you. But itwouldn’t be fair.”“Don’t be a fool, Giles,” said Lady Piercey angrily. “If you don’t seeit’s necessary, why, then, you can’t see an inch before your nose; andto argue with you isn’t any good.”“No,” he said, “perhaps it isn’t. I’m an obstinate old fool, and so areyou an obstinate old fool, Mary Ann. And between us both we’ve made amess of it. It wasn’t altogether our fault, perhaps, for it was Naturethat began,” said the old gentleman, with something like a whimperbreaking into his voice. “Nature, the worst of all, for you cannot doanything with that. Not a thing! We’ve tried our best. Yes; I believeyou tried your best, my lady, watching and worrying; and I’ve tried mybest, leaving things alone. But none of us can do anything. We can’t,you know, not if we were to go on till Doomsday; and we’re two oldfolks, and we can’t go on much longer. It’s not altogether your fault,and neither is it mine; but we’ll go to our graves, by-and-by, and we’llleave behind us--we’ll leave behind us----”Here the old gentleman, probably betrayed by the previous disturbance ofhis laughter, fell into a kind of nervous crying, half exclamations,half laughing, half tears.“Don’t you be upset, my lady,” said Dunning; “Sir Giles, he do get likethis sometimes when he’s flurried and frightened. But, Lord! a littleglassful of water, and a few of his drops, and he’s all right again.”Lady Piercey sat bolt upright in her chair. She, too, wanted theministrations to which she was accustomed: the arm of Parsons to helpher up, or Margaret to turn to, to upbraid her for her uncle’s state, orto consult her as to what to do. She had not the same tendency to tears,though a few iron drops came from time to time, wrung out by her greattrouble. She sat and stared at her husband, and at Dunning’s services tohim, till Sir Giles was quite restored. And then she rose with somestiffness and difficulty, and hobbled away. Parsons met her at the door,and took her mistress to her room; but, though Lady Piercey clung toher, the maid was not at all well received. “What were you doing at SirGiles’ door? What do you want in this part of the house?” she cried,though she had seized and clung to the ready arm. “I’ll not have youspying about, seeing what you can pick up in the way of news, orlistening at a door.”“I never listened at a door in my life,” cried Parsons, indignant. “Andnobody ever named such a thing to me, my lady, but you!”“Oh, hold your tongue, do!” cried Lady Piercey. And she, too, like SirGiles, was obliged to have a restorative when she had been safelyconveyed to her room. She was the ruler upstairs, and he below. She hadthe advantage of him in being able to move about, notwithstanding herrheumatism, and the large share she had of those ills which flesh isheir to--all those which were not appropriated first by her husband--inwhich she took a certain satisfaction, not tempered, rather enhanced, bythe attendant pain.The letters came in at the hour of luncheon, and were taken to LadyPiercey as they are usually taken to the master of the house. She openedall the family-letters, her husband’s as well as her own, and even theoccasional bill or note that came very rarely for Gervase. Among themthat day came a letter stamped with the Piercey crest, at which shegazed for a moment before opening it, with an indignant, yet scaredlook, as if she had beheld a blasphemy, and which made her, when sheopened it, almost jump from her seat. She read it over twice, with hereyes opening wider and wider, and the red flush of surprise and horrorrising on her face, then flung it violently across the table toMargaret. “Then he must go, that’s flat! and to-morrow morning, not onehour later,” she cried. Gervase was in the room, paying no attention tothis pantomime, and caring nothing for what letters might arrive; but hewas roused by what she said. He cried, “That’s me, mother; I’m goingto-morrow,” with his loud and vacant laugh.CHAPTER XIV.The letter which Lady Piercey had received, and which quickened soinstantaneously her determination that Gervase should be gratified inhis desire to visit London, did not seem at the first glance to haveanything to do with that question. It was a letter from Gerald Piercey,asking to be allowed to come on a visit of two or three days to see hisrelations at Greyshott. Now, Gerald Piercey was, after Gervase, theheir-at-law--or rather he was the son of the old and infirm gentlemanwho was the heir-at-law. He was a soldier who had distinguished himselfin India, and got rapid promotion, so that he had several lettersalready tacked to his name, and was in every way a contrast to theunfortunate who stood between him and the honours of the house. It wasnatural, and I think it was excusable, that poor Lady Piercey shouldhate this successful and highly esteemed person. To be sure, he was mucholder than Gervase--a man of forty, so that there was, as she saidindignantly, no comparison! and she herself was not old enough (or atleast, so she said) to have had a son of the Colonel’s age. But thesecircumstances, which should have lessened the sense of rivalry, onlymade it greater, for even if Gervase had not been a Softy, he wouldnever have been a man of so much importance as this cousin of theyounger branch who had made himself known and noted in the world by hisown personal character and deserts. Colonel Piercey had not been atGreyshott since he was a youth setting out in life, when he had paid hisrelations a hasty and not very agreeable visit. Gervase was then a sillylittle boy; but there are many silly little boys who grow up intotolerable young men; and his parents, at least, had by no means made uptheir minds to the fact of his inferiority. But Gerald, a young man whohad just joined his regiment and was full of the elation and pleasure inlife which is never greater than in these circumstances, who resembledthe family portraits and knew all about the family history, and wholooked so entirely the part of heir of the house, awoke a causelessenmity even in the jovial breast of Sir Giles, then a robust fox-hunter,master of the hounds, chairman of quarter sessions, and everything thata country gentleman should be. Poor little Gervase was nothing besidehim, naturally! for Gervase was but a child, however clever he had been.But this thought did not heal the painful impression, the shock of asensation too keen almost to be borne. All the neighbours were delightedwith Gerald. What a fine young fellow! what a promising young man! whata pity it was---- and the visitors gave a glance aside at poor littleGervase, already, poor child, the Softy among all his childishcompanions. They did not utter that last half-formed regret, but SirGiles and his wife perceived it on their lips, in their thoughts, andhated Gerald, which was wrong, no doubt, but very natural and almostpardonable, from a parent’s point of view.And here he was coming back! a guest whom they could not refuse, acredit to the family, a distinguished relation, while Gervase was whathe was. But Gerald Piercey should not, Lady Piercey resolved, seeGervase as he was,--not for the world! He was coming, no doubt, to spyout the nakedness of the land--but what he should find would only be anaccount of her son enjoying himself in London, seeing life, doing asother young men did. If Gerald was a colonel and a C.B., Gervase shouldbear the aspect of a young man about town--a man of fashion, goingeverywhere; a man who had no occasion to go to India to distinguishhimself, having a good estate and a baronetcy behind him at home. Tokeep up this fiction would be easy if Gervase were but absent. It wouldbe impossible, alas! to do it in his presence. Lady Piercey exertedherself during that day, in a way she had not been known to do beforefor years. She wrote a long letter, bending over it, and working all thelines of her mouth like a schoolboy. It was labour dire and weary woe,for a woman who had long given up any exertion of the kind for herself.But in this case she would not trust even Margaret. And then she hadGervase’s drawers emptied, and his clothes brought to her to make asurvey. They were not fashionable clothes by any means; Lady Piercey,though she was not much used to men of fashion, and knew nothing of what“was worn” at the time, yet knew and remembered enough to feel thatGervase in these garments would by no means bear the aspect of a youngman about town. But he would do very well in the Gregson world inBloomsbury; everybody who saw him there would know that he was young Mr.Piercey of Greyshott, Sir Giles’ only son. This is the sort of fact thatcovers a multitude of sins, even in clothes. And in Bloomsbury the firstfashions were not likely to be worn. He would pass muster very wellthere, but not--not before the eyes of Gerald Piercey, the colonel, theC.B., the cousin and heir. “You don’t see why I should be in such ahurry,” said Lady Piercey, with one of those glances which only want thepower, not the desire, to kill. “I know, then, and that’s enough,Gervase, my boy. You’ll remember to be very good and please your poorfather and me, now we’ve consented to give you this great treat, and letyou go.”“Oh, yes,” said Gervase, with a laugh; “I’ll remember, mother. I sha’n’tbe let go wrong, you take your oath of that.”“What does he mean by not being let? You’ve told him about Gregson, Meg!Well, my dear, you know that is the only comfort I have. You’ll be metat the station, and you’ll find your nice rooms ready; and very luckyyou are, Gervase, to find so good a person to take care of you. Doeverything he tells you; mind, he knows all about you; and he’ll alwayslead you the right road, as you say.”Gervase, staring open-mouthed at his mother, burst into a great laugh.He was astonished at her apparent knowledge of the companion who wouldnot let him go wrong, but the confusion of the pronoun daunted him alittle. Did she think it was old Hewitt that was going with him? He hadenough of cunning to ask no questions, but laughed with a great roar ofsatisfaction mingled with wonderment. Lady Piercey put up her hands toher ears.“Don’t make such a noise,” she said. “You laugh like your father,Gervase, and you’re too young to roar like that. You must try to behavevery nicely, too, and don’t roar the roof off a London house with yourlaughing. And don’t make a noise in company, Gervase. We put up witheverything here because we’re so fond of you; but in town, thoughthey’ll be fond of you, it makes a difference, not being used to youfrom your cradle. You must remember all I taught you about manners whenyou were a little boy.”“Oh, mother, don’t you be afraid; my manners will be well looked after,too. I sha’n’t dare to open my mouth,” said Gervase, with anotherlaugh.“Well, I believe they are very particular,” said Lady Piercey, with astill more bewildering change of pronouns. “And, Gervase, there’s youngladies there: mind that you are very nice and civil to them, but don’tgo any further than you can draw back.”“Oh, I’ll be kept safe from the young ladies, you take your oath ofthat!” he cried, with another shout of a laugh.“For goodness gracious sake,” cried Lady Piercey, “take him away!--Meg,can’t you take him away and give him a good talking to? You have nonerves, and I’m nothing but a bundle of ’em. That laugh of his goes upto the crown of my head and down to the soles of my feet. Take him off,and let me look over his things in peace. And mind, Gervase, you’ve tolisten to what Meg says to you, just the same as if I were speakingmyself; for she knows about men, having married one, and she can giveyou a deal of good advice. Go out to the beech avenue, and then I cansee you from my window, and make sure that you are paying attention towhat she says.”When Gervase was safely outside with his patient cousin, whose part inall these proceedings was so laborious and uninterrupted, though she wasnot permitted to do much more than look on--he plucked off his hat andflung it up into the air in triumph, executing at the same time a sortof dance upon the gravel.“Does she mean what she says, Meg? and how has she heard of it? and whathas made her give in? Lord! what will some folks say when they know thatit’s all with her will?”“What is it you are going to do, Gervase? and what do you mean by ‘somefolks’?” Margaret cried.The Softy looked at her for a moment irresolute, doubtful, it wouldseem, what he should reply; and then he laughed again, more loudly thanever, and said: “Shouldn’t you like to know?”“Yes, I should like to know. I do not believe that they know at all whatyou mean. You are too cunning for them. You are going to take somestep----”“More than one--many steps. I’m going to London to see all that’s goingon--to see life. I told ’em so; and instead of looking curious like you,mother, don’t you see, she knows all about it, and wants me to do it.Mother’s a trump! She is that fond of me, she will do whatever I say.”“The thing is, what are you going to do, Gervase? What do you mean byseeing life?”He laughed longer than ever, and gave her a nudge with his arm. “Oh, getalong, Meg!” he said,--“_you_ know.”“No, Gervase; tell me. You have always been a good boy--you are notgoing to do any harm?”“I never heard it was any harm; it’s what everybody does, and rejoicingsabout it, and bells ringing, and all that. Don’t you tell--I’m going----No; I said I wouldn’t say a word, and I won’t. You’ll know when I comeback.”“Gervase, you frighten me very much--you wouldn’t deceive your fatherand mother that love you so.” She drew a long breath of alarm; thenadded with relief: “But if he is met at the station and taken careof----”“That’s it,” said Gervase. “I’m going to be met at the station, andeverything done for me. I’ll never be left to myself any more. I’m notvery good at taking care of myself, Meg.”“No,” she cried; “that is quite true. I am so glad you feel that,Gervase. Then you won’t be rebellious, but do what your mother wishes,and what her friend tells you. It will make her so happy.”“Her friend! Who’s her friend?” said Gervase; and then the peal of hislaughter arose once more. “I like my own friend best; but my friend andmy mother’s friend being just the same, don’t you see?”“Are they the same?” said Mrs. Osborne, thoroughly perplexed.“There ain’t two of them that are going to meet me at the station? No?then there’s only one. And mother’s a trump, and I’ll do everything I’mtold, and never be without some one to guide me all my life. And tostand up for me--for I am put upon, Meg, though you don’t seem to seeit. I am; and made a jest of; and no money in my pocket; never given myproper place. Meg, how much is mamma going to give me for mypocket-money while I’m away?”“I can’t tell you, Gervase. There will be your travelling money, andprobably she will send the rest to---- to be given you when you are intown.”“I ought to have it now in my own pocket,” said Gervase, with a cloudupon his brow. “Do you think a man can go like a man to London town,and no money? They are mad if they think that. Lend us something,Meg--you’ve got a little, and no need to spend it; with everything givenyou that heart can wish. Why, you never spend a penny! And I’ll pay itall back when I come to my own.”“I have nothing,” she said, faltering. To tell what was not strictlytrue, and to refuse what her cousin asked, were things equally dreadfulto Margaret--and it was a relief to her when Lady Piercey’s window wasjerked open by a rapid hand, and the old lady’s head appeared suddenlythrust out.“You’re not talking to him, Meg; you’re letting him talk to you. Don’tlet us have more of that. You’re there to give him good advice, andthat’s what we expect of you. Don’t you hear?” And the window was snaptwith another emphatic jerk.“Gervase, I am to advise you,” said Margaret, trembling, though thesituation was ludicrous enough, and she might have laughed had the casebeen other than her own. The watchful eye upon her from the window, thetotally unadvisable young man by her side, were not, however, ludicrousbut dreadful to Margaret. Her sense of humour was obscured by thepiteous facts of the case: the young man entirely insensible to anyreason, and his mother, who had never lost her primitive faith that ifsome one only “talked to him,” Gervase would be just as sensible asother men. “But how can I advise you? I am troubled about what you aregoing to do. I hope you will not do anything to grieve them, Gervase.They are old people----”“Yes,” said Gervase, with a nod and a look of wisdom; “they are prettyold.”“They are old people,” said Margaret, “and they have a great many thingsto put up with: they have illnesses and weakness--and they have anxietyabout you.”“They needn’t trouble their heads about me. I’ve got some one to lookafter me. She said it wasn’t I,” cried Gervase with a chuckle.“That is while you are in London; but they think of you all day long,and are always thinking of you. You will not do anything to grieve them,Gervase, while you are away?”“How can I when I’m going to be looked after all the time, and somebodyto meet me at the station?” cried Gervase, with his loud laugh.Lady Piercey was very anxious afterwards to know what advice Margarethad given to her son. The “things” had all been looked over and packed;and it took Lady Piercey a long time to consider what money she couldtrust her son with when he went away. She had intended at first to sendsome one with him to pay his railway ticket, and to send what he wouldwant in London to Dr. Gregson. But then, what if an accident happened?what if Gregson failed to meet him, or appropriated the money? which wasa thing always on the cards with so poor a man, the old lady thought. Itcould not be that the heir of Greyshott, Sir Giles’ son, should leavehis home penniless. She took out her cash-box, for she was the managerof everything, and had all the money interests of Greyshott in herhands--and took from it a five-pound note, over which she mused andpondered long, weighing it in her hand as if that were the way ofjudging. Then she put it back, and took out a ten-pound note. Ten poundsis a great deal of money. Much good as well as much harm can be donewith ten pounds. It is such a large sum of money that, if you trust aman with that, you may trust him with more. She took outanother--wavering, hesitating--now disposed to put it back, now layingit with the other, poising them both in her hands. Finally, with a quicksigh, she shut up the cash-box sharply and suddenly, and gave it toParsons to be put back in the cabinet, where it usually dwelt; andfolding up the notes, directed her niece to put them in an envelope.“Twenty pounds!” she said, with a gasp. Her two supporters had beenpresent during all this process, and Parsons was exactly aware how muchmoney was to be trusted in the pockets of the Softy, and thought itexcessive. Lady Piercey sat by grimly, and looked on while the money wasenclosed in the envelope, and then she turned briskly to her companion.“You had a long talk, Meg,” she said; “and I suppose you gave him agreat deal of advice. You ought to know, you that had as husband anofficer, for they are always in the heat of everything. What advice didyou give to my boy?”CHAPTER XV.Colonel Piercey arrived next day in the afternoon, Gervase having goneaway in a state of the most uproarious spirits in the morning. Margarethad been made to accompany him to the railway, to see that his ticketwas taken properly, and that he got the right train, and was not toolate so as to miss it, or too early so as to be lingering about thestation; in which latter circumstance it seemed quite possible to hismother that “that girl” might become aware that her prey was slippingfrom her fingers, and appear upon the scene to recover him. She mightsave herself the trouble, Lady Piercey thought, for the boy’s brain wasfull of London, and a country lass was not likely to get much hold ofhim; but still, it’s best to be on the safe side. No suggestion ofPatty’s real intentions had occurred to any one; not even in the SevenThorns, where they suspected much less than at Greyshott. In the littleinn it was supposed that the Softy had been, after all, too clever forher, and had got clean away; and in the Manor it was also believed thathe had escaped from her vulgar attractions. He had got London in hisblood, he was thinking of how to enjoy himself as much as he was capableof thinking of anything, and the Rev. Gregson would take care of that,his mother reflected with a grim smile. And to have him safely away,transferred to some one else’s responsibility, no longer for the momenta trouble to any one belonging to him, filled Greyshott in general, andhis parents in particular, with a heavenly calm. The only one who wasnot perfectly at ease was Mrs. Osborne, who endeavoured in vain to makeout what he meant by many of his broken expressions. Margaret was surethat Gervase meant something which was not suspected by his family: butshe, too, believed that he had somehow cut himself adrift from Patty,and that whatever his meaning was, in that quarter he was safe; whichshowed that though she was very different from the rest of thehousehold, her mind, even when awakened into some anxiety and alarm, hadlittle more insight than theirs.She was met upon the road by Osy and his nurse, and the little boy wasdelighted to be lifted into the carriage, an unusual privilege. Hischatter was sweet to his mother’s ears. It delivered her for the momentfrom those anxieties which were not hers, which she was compelled toshare without any right to them; without being permitted any realinterest. Osy was her refuge, the safeguard of her individuality as aliving woman with concerns and sentiments of her own. To put her armsround him, to hear the sound of his little babbling voice, was enough atfirst; and then she awoke with a start to the consciousness that Osy wassaying something in which there was not only meaning, but asignificance of a most alarming kind--“Movver, Movver!” the little boyhad been saying, calling her attention, which was so satisfied with him,that it was scarcely open to what he said. He beat upon her knee withhis little fist, then climbed up on the seat and seized her by thechin--a favourite mode he had of demanding to be listened to: “Movver!has Cousin Gervase don to be marrwed? Where has he don to bemarrwed--tell me; tell me, Movver!”Mrs. Osborne started with a sudden perception of what he meant at last.“Osy, you must not be so silly; Gervase has gone to London to see allthe fine things--the shops, don’t you remember? and the theatres, andthe beautiful horses, and the beautiful ladies in the park.”“Yes, I wemember; there was one beau’ful lady with an organ, that singedin the street. But you said I couldn’t marrwey her, I was too little.Will Cousin Gervase marrwey a lady like that?”“Hush, child! he is not going to marry at all.”“Oh yes, yes, Movver! for he telled me. He made me dive him my bigsilver penny that Uncle Giles dave me, and he said, ‘I’m doing to bemarrwed, Osy.’ I dave it to him for a wedding present, like you daveMiss Dohnson your silver bells.”“Osy, don’t say such things! It is nurse that has put this nonsense intoyour head.”“’Tisn’t nurse, and ’tisn’t nonsense, Movver!” cried the child withindignation. “Will he bring home the beau’ful lady, or will he do awaywith her, and live in another place? I hope he will go and live inanother place.”“Osy, this is all an invention, my little boy. You must be dreaming.Don’t say such things before any one, or you will make Uncle Giles andAunt Piercey very unhappy. It is one of your little stories that youmake up.”“It isn’t no story, Movver! I never make up stories about CousinGervase; and he tooked my big silver penny, and then I dave it him for awedding present; for he said ‘I’m doing to be marrwed.’ He did; hedid--Movver! I hope he’ll do away and live in another house. I dave itto him,” said Osy, with a little moisture on his eyelashes. “But hetooked it first. It was my big, big, silver penny, that is worth agreat lot. I hope----”“Hush, Osy: don’t you know, my little boy, that Cousin Gervase is to hismother what you are to me? She would not like him to go away.”“I heard Uncle Giles say, ‘T’ank God, we’ve dot a little time tobreathe,’ and Aunt Piercey dave a great, great, big puff, and sat downas if she was t’ankful, too. It is only you, Movver, that looks sad.”“Osy, did you ever hear of the little pitchers that have long ears?”“I know what it means, too,” said the child. “It means me; but I tan’thelp it when people say fings. Movver, are you fond of Cousin Gervase,that you looks like that? like you were doing to cry?”Was she fond of Gervase, poor boy? Margaret could not even claim thatexcuse for being sad. Was she fond of any of the people by whom she wassurrounded, who held her in subjection? At least, she was terriblyperturbed by the cloud that hung over them--the possible trouble thatwas about to befall them. Poor Gervase was not very much to build hopesor wishes upon, but he was all they had; and if it were possible that hewas meditating any such steps, what a terrible blow for his father andmother!--a stroke which they would feel to the bottom of their hearts.For himself, was it, indeed, so sad? Was it not, perhaps, the best thinghe could do? Her mind went over the possibilities as by a lightningflash. Patty--if it was Patty--if there was anything in it--was probablythe best wife he could get. She was energetic and determined; she wouldtake care of him for her own sake. And who else would marry the Softy?Margaret’s mind leapt on further to possible results, and to a suddenperception that little Osy, had he ever had any chance of succession,would be hopelessly set aside by this step, and the only possible rewardof her own slavery be swept from her horizon. This forced itself uponher, through the crowd of other thoughts, with a chill to her heart. Butwhat chance had Osy ever had? And who could put any confidence in thestatement of Gervase to the child? Perhaps it was only “his fun.” Thelittle theft of the money was nothing remarkable; for Gervase, who neverhad any money, was always on the look-out for unconsidered trifles,which he borrowed eagerly. Perhaps this was all. Perhaps the half-wittedyoung man meant nothing but a joke--one of his kind of jokes--for whyshould he have betrayed himself to little Osy? On the other hand, therewere those allusions to some one who was to meet him, which he hadlaughed at so boisterously, and which she could not imagine referred toDr. Gregson. Margaret’s bewilderment grew greater the more she thought.“Osy,” she said, as they turned up the avenue, “you must forget allthis, for it is nonsense.”“About my big, big, silver penny?” said the child, the water nowstanding in his eyes; for the more he thought of his loss, which he hadcarried off in childish pride with a high hand at first, the more Osyfelt it. “It is not nonsense, Movver,” he said, “for it is true.”“About what Cousin Gervase said? It was very wrong of him, but that isnot true, Osy. He must have said it for a joke. Don’t say anything.Promise me, dear! Not a word.”“Not to you, Movver?” said the little boy, two big tears dropping fromhis eyes; “for I tan’t, tan’t bear to lose my silver penny, and I wouldnot mind if it was a wedding present. I want my silver penny back!”“We’ll find you another one, dear, that will be just as good.”“But it won’t be my own one, and I want my own one,” Osy said. He wasstill sobbing with long-drawn childish reverberation of woe when theygot to the door; but there he took a great resolution. “I’ll fink it wasa wedding present,” he cried, “and then I sha’n’t mind. I’ll fink he isgoing to be marrwed, and I’ll never say a word, because nobody knows butme.”This valorous resolve exercised a great control, and yet was very hardto keep up during the long afternoon which followed. It rained in thelater part of the day, and Sir Giles could not go out, so that Osy,restored to all the privileges which had been a little curtailed duringGervase’s temporary reign, became once more a leading member of theparty. And how often that important secret came bursting to the littlefellow’s lips! But he kept his word, like a gentleman. Margaret heardhim singing it to himself as he capered about the room on Sir Giles’stick, “Doing to be marrwed, doing to be marrwed,” which relieved hismind without betraying his knowledge. It even attracted Sir Giles’attention, who called to him to know what he was singing.“It’s a silly rhyme he has just picked up,” said Margaret, interposing,which was a thing the old people did not like.“He can tell me himself,” said Sir Giles; “he’s quite clever enough.”“No, it isn’t a silly rhyme,” said little Osy; “it’s me myself, that ama gweat prince riding upon a noble steed, and I’m doing to bemarrwed--I’m doing to be marrwed!”“And who’s the bride, Osy; who’s the bride?” said Sir Giles, in highgood humour.“It is a beau’ful lady in London that singed in the streets, with a bignapkin on her head. But Movver said I was too little to marrwey her. I’ma man now, and a soldier and a gweat, gweat knight; and I can marrweyany one I please.”“That’s the thing!” said old Sir Giles; “don’t you be tied to yourmother’s apron-strings, my boy. The ladies always want to rule over usmen, don’t they? and some of us must make a stand, you know.” The oldgentleman laughed at his joke till he cried, the old lady sitting grimlyby. But she, too, smiled upon the little rebel: “You’ll not find himsuch an easy one to guide when he grows up, Meg,” she said, nodding herhead. “He’s got the Piercey temper, for all it’s so amusing now. Itain’t amusing when they grow up,” said Lady Piercey, shaking her head.But she, too, encouraged Osy to defy his mother. He was a pretty sightcareering round the dim library like a stray sunbeam, his littlelaughing face flushed with play and praise. Had the child been cleverenough to invent that little fiction, innocent baby as he looked?--orhad he really forgotten, as children will, and believed himself the heroof his little song? But this was one of the mysteries that seven yearscan hide from everybody as well as seventy, and Margaret could not tell.Now that Gervase was gone the boy seemed to fall into his place again,the darling of everybody, the centre of all their thoughts. And whocould tell what might happen? Osy was not the next in succession, but hewas not far out of the line. Margaret tried to put all such thoughts outof her mind, but it was difficult to do so, with the sight of Osy’striumph and sway over them--two old people who were so fond of him andcould do so much for him--before their eyes.There came a moment, however, no further off than that evening, whenevery furtive hope of this description died at a blow out of MargaretOsborne’s heart. It was not that Osy was less admired and petted, orthat he had offended or transgressed in any way. It was simply thearrival at Greyshott of Colonel Gerald Piercey that had this effect. Itwas she who met him first as he came into the hall, springing down fromthe dogcart that had brought him from the station, and at the firstglance her heart had died within her. Not that there was anythingalarming in his aspect. He had attained, with his forty years, to an airof distinction which Margaret did not remember in him; and a look ofcommand, of easy superiority, of the habit of being obeyed. This habitis curiously impressive to those who do not possess it. The very soundof his step as he came in was enough. Not a man to lose anything onwhich his hand had once closed, not one to risk or relinquish hisrights, whatever they might be. Osy, by the side of this man! Her hopes,which had never ventured to put themselves into words, died on themoment a natural death. She advanced to meet the stranger, as in dutybound, being the only valid member of the family, and said, holding outher hand with a smile which she felt to be apologetic: “You are welcometo Greyshott, Cousin Gerald. My uncle and aunt are neither of them verywell, and Gervase is from home. You don’t remember me. I am MargaretOsborne, your cousin, too.”“I remember you,” he said, “very well; but pardon me if I did notremember your face. I fear that is a bad compliment for a lady.”“Not at all,” she said; “a good compliment: for I am more, I hope, thanmy face.”He did not understand the look she gave him, a wondering look with anappeal in it. Would he be good to Osy? Margaret felt as if this man werecoming in like a conqueror--sweeping all the old, and feeble, andfoolish of the house away before him, that he might step in and reign.He, on his side, had no such thought. He had come to pay a duty visit,moved thereto by his father. He had not been at Greyshott for manyyears; he remembered little, and thought less, of Gervase, who had beena child on his previous visit. That he should ever be master of theplace, or sweep anybody away, was far from his thoughts. He followedinto the library the slim, serious figure of this middle-aged woman in ablack gown, horrified to think that this was Meg Piercey, the livelygirl of his recollection. This Meg Piercey! It was true that heremembered her very well, a madcap of a girl, ready for any mischief;but this was certainly not the face he remembered, the young, daring,buoyant figure. It might have wounded Margaret, accustomed as she was tobe considered as nobody, if she had been aware of the consternation withwhich he regarded her. A middle-aged woman! though not so old by a goodmany years as himself, who was still conscious of being young.The visit, however, began very successfully. As he had no _arrièrepensée_, he was quite at his ease with the old people whom he neithermeant to sweep away nor to succeed. He received, quite naturally, thelong and elaborate apologies of Lady Piercey in respect to her son.“Gervase will be very sorry to miss you, Gerald,--he’s in town; there isnot much to amuse a young man in the country at this season of the year.He’s not fond of garden parties and so forth, the only things that aregoing on, and not many of them yet. He prefers town. Perhaps it isn’t tobe wondered at. We have all liked to see a little life in our day.”What “life” could it have been that Lady Piercey in her day had liked tosee? the new-comer asked himself, with an involuntary smile. But he tookthe explanation with the easiest good humour, thinking no evil.“Lucky fellow!” he said; “he has the best of it. I was out in India allmy young time, and saw only a very different kind of life.”“Come,” said Sir Giles, “you amuse yourselves pretty well out there.Don’t give yourself airs, Gerald.”“Oh, yes; we amuse ourselves more or less,” he said, with a pleasantlaugh. “Enough to make us envy a young swell like Gervase, who, Isuppose, has all the world at his feet and nothing to do.”There was a strange pause in the room; a sort of furtive look betweenthe ladies; a sound--he could not tell what--from Sir Giles. ColonelPiercey had a faint comprehension that he had, as he said to himself,put his foot in it. What had he said that was not the right thing tosay? He caught Margaret’s eye, and there was a warning in it, a sort ofappeal; but he had not an idea what its meaning was.“I am sure,” said Lady Piercey, with a voice out of which she vainlyendeavoured to keep the little break and whimper which was habitual toher when she was moved, “my boy might have all the world at his feet--ifhe was that kind, Gerald. But he’s not that kind; he’s of a differentsort. He takes things in a---- in a kind of philosophical way.”“Humph!” said Sir Giles, pushing back his chair. “Meg, Gerald will notmind if I have my backgammon. I’m an old fogey, you see, my boy, withlong days to get through, and not able to get out. I’m past amusement. Ionly kill the time as well as I can now.”“I’m very fond of a game of backgammon, too, Uncle Giles.”“Are you, boy? why, that’s something like. Meg, I’ll give you a holiday.Ladies are very nice, but they never know the rules of a game,” theungrateful old gentleman said.CHAPTER XVI.That evening in the library at Greyshott was the most cheerful that hadbeen known for a long time; Colonel Piercey made himself thoroughly athome. He behaved to the old people as if they had been the most genialfriends of his youth. He told them stories of India and his experiencesthere. He played backgammon with Sir Giles, and let him win the game ascleverly as Dunning did, and with more grace. He admired Lady Piercey’swork and suggested a change in the shading, at which both she andParsons exclaimed with delight that it would make all the difference! Hewas delightful to everybody except Margaret, of whom he took very littlenotice, which was a strange thing in so apparently chivalrous and kind aman, seeing in what a subject condition she was kept, how much requiredof her, and so little accorded to her, in the strange family party ofwhich the two servants formed an almost unfailing part. Margaret feltherself left out in the cold with a completeness which surprised her,much as she was accustomed to the feeling that she was of no account.She had no desire that Gerald Piercey should pity her; but it wascurious to see how he ignored her, never turning even a look her way,addressing her only when necessity required. It has always been a theoryof mine that there exists between persons of opposite sexes who are nolonger to be classed within the lines of youth, middle-aged people, orinclining that way, a repulsion instead of an attraction. A young mantolerates a girl even when she does not please him, because she is awoman; but a man of forty or so dislikes his contemporary on thisaccount; is impatient of her; feels her society a burden, almost anaffront to him. He calls her old, and he calls himself young; perhapsthat has something to do with it. Colonel Piercey was not shabby enoughto entertain consciously any such feeling; but he shared itunconsciously with many other men. He thought the less of her foraccepting that position, for submitting to be the _souffre-douleur_ ofthe household. He suspected her, instinctively, of having designs of--heknew not what kind,--of being underhand, of plotting her own advantagesomehow, to the harm of the two old tyrants who exacted so much fromher. Would she continue to hold such a place, to expose herself to somuch harsh treatment, if it were not for some end of her own? It wastrue that he could not make out what that end would be; that thereshould be any possibility of the child (who was delightful) supplantingor succeeding Gervase, was not an idea that ever entered his mind.Gervase was a young man of whom he knew nothing, whom he supposed to belike other young men. And, after Gervase came the old General, GeraldPiercey’s father, and himself. There was no possibility of any intruderin that place. He supposed that it was their money she must beafter--to get them to leave all they could to her. Meg Piercey! the girlwhom he could not help remembering still, who was not in the least likethis pale person: to think that years and poverty should have broughtthat bright creature to this!“I almost wonder, Gerald,” said Lady Piercey, as she sat among her silkswith an air of ease diffused over all the surroundings, working a littleby turns and pausing to watch benignantly the process of thebackgammon,--“I almost wonder that you did not meet my boy at thestation. His train would come in just before yours left, and I have beenthinking since then that you might have met. He was to meet an oldfriend, an excellent old clergyman, with whom he was to spend a fewdays. Though he is full of spirit, my Gervase is very fond of all hisold friends.”“Humph!” said Sir Giles; but that was only perhaps because at thatmoment he made an injudicious move.“I should not have known him had I met him,” said the Colonel, carefullymaking a move more injudicious still, to the delight of Sir Giles; “youforget he was only a child when I was here. I saw an old clergymanroaming about, looking into all the carriages: was that your friend, Iwonder? He had found no one up to that time.”“You sent Gregson after him then, my lady?” said Sir Giles; “though Isaid it wasn’t fair.”“Why Sir Giles says it wasn’t fair is this, Gerald,” said Lady Piercey;“and you can judge between us. He thought because the boy was going toenjoy himself he shouldn’t be troubled with old friends; but I thought agood judicious old clergyman, that had known him from his cradle,couldn’t be in any one’s way.”“I see your point of view,” said Colonel Gerald, “but I think for mypart I agree with Uncle Giles. At Gervase’s age I should have thoughtthe old clergyman a bore.”“Ah! but my Gervase is one in a thousand,” Lady Piercey said, noddingher head and pursing up her lips.“I saw another group at the station that amused me,” said Gerald: “ayoung country-fellow with something of the look of a gentleman, and agirl all clad in gorgeous apparel, who had not in the least the look ofa lady. They got out of the train arm-in-arm, he holding her just as ifhe feared she might run away--which was the last thing I should say shehad any intention of doing. Is there any _hobereau_ about here with ataste for rustic beauties? They were newly married, I should think, orgoing to be married. He, in a loud state of delight, and she---- Ishould think she had made a good stroke of business, that little girl.”“I don’t know of any name like Hobero,” said Lady Piercey; “but thereare a great many stations between this and London. I dare say theydidn’t come from hereabouts at all. Girls of that class are dreadful.They dress so that you don’t know what kind they are--neither flesh norfish nor red herring, as the proverb is--and their manners--but theyhaven’t got any. They think nothing is too good for them.”“The woman in this case, I should say, knew very well that the youngfellow was too good for her, but had no thought of giving him up. And hewas wild with delight, a silly sort of fellow--not all there.” ColonelPiercey’s looks were bent unconsciously as he spoke upon thewriting-table which stood behind Sir Giles’ chair, and on which somephotographs were arranged; and from the partial darkness there suddenlyshone out upon him, from the whiteness of a large vignette, a face whichhe recognised. He cried, “Hallo!” in spite of himself as it seemed, andthen, with a sudden start, looked at Margaret. She had grown pale, andas he looked at her she grew red, and lifted a warning finger. TheColonel sank back upon his seat with a consternation he could scarcelydisguise.“What’s the matter, Gerald?” said Sir Giles, who was arranging steadilyupon the board the black and white men for another game.“Only the sight of that old cabinet which I remember so well,” cried thesoldier, with a curious tone in his voice. “It used to be one of ourfavourite puzzles to find out the secret drawers. When Mrs. Osborne wasMiss Piercey,” he continued, to give him an excuse for looking towardsher again. Margaret had bent her head over her work. Was that what itmeant? he asked himself. Was this designing woman in the secret? Wasthis her plan to harm her cousin, and get him into trouble with hisparents? His face grew stern as he looked at her. He thought there wasguilt in every line of her attitude. She could not face him, or giveany account of the meaning in her eyes.“Ay, it’s a queer old thing,” said Sir Giles; “many a one has tried hiswits at it, and had to give up. It’s very different from your modernthings.”“You should see my Gervase at it,” said Lady Piercey. “He pulls out onedrawer after another, as if he had made it all. I never could fathom itfor my part, though I have sat opposite to it in this chair forfive-and-thirty years. But Gervase has it all at his fingers’ ends.”“Pooh! he’s known it all his life,” said Sir Giles. “Gerald, my finefellow, we’ve just time for another before I go to bed.”“Surely, Uncle,” said Gerald; but it seemed to him that he had becomeall at once conscious of another game that was being played; a tragicgame, with hearts and lives instead of bits of ivory--a hapless youngfellow in the hands of two women, one of whom he had been made tobelieve he loved, in order to carry out the schemes of the other who wasplanning and scheming behind backs to deprive him of his natural rights.Imagination made a great leap to attain to such a fully developedtheory, but it did so with a spring. Colonel Piercey thought that thepresence of this woman, pale, self-restrained, bearing everyhumiliation, was accounted for now.“Why did Gerald Piercey look at you so, Meg?” asked Lady Piercey. Shehad said she felt tired, and risen and said good night earlier thanusual, seizing her niece’s arm, not waiting till Parsons should come ather ordinary hour. She was fatigued with all the strain about Gervase;getting him off at the right hour, and getting all his “things” inorder; and making out that new wonderful character for him to dazzle thevisitor. She had a right indeed to be tired, having gone through so muchthat was exciting, and succeeded in everything, especially the last ofher efforts. “Why did he look at you and talk that nonsense about theold cabinet? Something had come into his head.”“I supposed he thought, Aunt, of the time when we used to make fun overit, and ask all the visitors to find it out.”“Perhaps he did,” said the old lady; “but though he looked at you thatonce, you needn’t expect that he’s going to pay attention to you, Meg.He thinks you’re dreadfully gone off. I saw that as soon as he came intothe room. You can see it in a moment from the way a man turns his head.”“I don’t doubt that he is quite right,” said Margaret, with a littlespirit.“Oh, yes; he’s right enough. You’re a very different girl from what youused to be,” said Lady Piercey. “But you don’t like to hear it, Meg; foryou don’t give me half the support you generally do. I don’t feel yourarm at all. It is as if I had nothing to lean on. I wish Parsons washere.”“Will you sit down for a moment and rest, and I will call Parsons?”“Why should I rest---- between the library and the stairs? I want to getto my room; I want to get to bed. What---- what are you standing therefor, not giving me your arm? I’ll---- I’ll be on my nose---- if youdon’t mind. Give me---- your arm, Meg. Meg!” The old lady gave a dullcry, and moved her left arm about as if groping for some support,though the other was clasped strongly in that of Margaret, who washolding up her aunt’s large wavering person with all the might she had.As she cried out for help, Lady Piercey sank down like a tower falling,dragging her companion with her; yet turning a last look of reproachupon her, and moving her lips, from which no sound came, with whatseemed like upbraiding. There was a rush from all quarters at Margaret’scry. Parsons and Dunning came flying, wiping their mouths, from themerry supper-table, where they had been discussing Mr. Gervase--and theother servants, in a crowd, and Gerald Piercey from the room they hadjust left. Margaret had disengaged herself as best she could from thefallen mass of flesh, and had got Lady Piercey’s head upon her shoulder,from which that large pallid countenance looked forth with wide openeyes, with a strange stare in them, some living consciousness minglingwith the stony look of the soul in prison. Except that stare, and amovement of the lips, which were unable to articulate, and a slightflicker of movement in the left hand, still groping, as it seemed, forsomething to clutch at, she was like a woman made of stone.And all in a moment, without any warning; without a sign that any oneunderstood! Parsons, wailing, said that she wasn’t surprised. Her ladyhad done a deal too much getting Mr. Gervase off; she had been worriedand troubled about him, poor dear innocent! She hadn’t slept a wink fortwo nights, groaning and turning in her bed. “But, for goodness gracioussake!” cried Parsons, “some one go back to master, or we’ll have him onour ’ands, too. Mrs. Osborne, Lord bless you! go to master. You can’t beno use here; we knows what to do--Dunning and me knows what to do. Goback to Sir Giles--go back to Sir Giles! or we won’t answer for none oftheir lives!”“Cousin Gerald, go to my uncle. Tell him she’s a little faint. I willcome directly and back you up, as soon as they can lift her. Go!” criedMargaret, with a severity that was not, perhaps, untouched, even at thisdreadful moment, by a consciousness of the opinion he was supposed tohave formed of her. It was as if she had stamped her foot at him, as shehalf-sat, half-lay, partially crushed by the fall of the old lady’sheavy body, with the great death-like face surmounted by the red ribbonsof the cap laid upon her breast. Those red ribbons haunted several mindsfor a long time after; they seemed to have become, somehow, the mosttragic feature of the scene.Colonel Piercey was not a man to interfere with a business that was nothis. He saw that the attendants knew what they were about, and left themwithout another word.Sir Giles was fuming a little over the interruption to his game. “What’sthe matter?” he said, testily. “You shouldn’t go and leave a gameunfinished for some commotion among the women. You don’t know ’em aswell as I do. Come along, come along; you’ve almost made me forget mylast move. What did Meg Osborne cry out for, eh? My old lady is sharp onher sometimes. She must have given her a stinger that time; but Megisn’t the girl to cry out.”“It was a---- stumble, I think,” said the Colonel.“Ay, ay! something of that kind. I know ’em, Gerald. I’m not easily putout. Come along and finish the game.”Margaret came in, some time after, looking very pale. She went behindher uncle’s chair, and put her hand on his shoulder, “May I wheel you toyour room, Uncle, if your game’s over, instead of Dunning? He asked meto tell you he was coming directly, and that it was time for you to goto bed.”“Confound Dunning,” cried Sir Giles, in his big rumbling voice. “I’mgame to go on as long as Frank here will play. I’ve not had such a nightfor ever so long. He’s a good player, but not good enough to beat me,”he said, with a muffled long odd laugh that reverberated in repeatedrolls like thunder.The Colonel looked up at her to get his instructions. He did not likeher, and yet he recognised in her the authority of the moment. AndMargaret no longer tried to conciliate him, as at first, but issuedforth her orders with a kind of sternness. “Let me wheel your chair,sir,” he said; “you’ll give me my revenge to-morrow? Three games out offour!--is that what you call entertaining a stranger, to beat him allalong the line the first night?”Sir Giles laughed loud and long in those rumbling, long-drawn peals. Hislaugh was like the red ribbons, and pointed the sudden tragedy. “Youshall have your revenge,” he said; “and plenty of it--plenty of it! Youshall cry off before I will. I love a good game. If it wasn’t for a goodgame, now and then, I don’t know what would become of me. As for Meg,she’s not worth naming; and my boy, Gervase, did his best, poor chap;but between you and me, Gerald, whatever my lady says, my boyGervase--poor chap, poor chap!” Here the old gentleman’s laughter brokedown as usual in the weakness of a sudden sob or two. “He’s not what Ishould like to see him, my poor boy Gervase,” he cried.He was taken to his room after a while, and soothed into cheerfulness,and had his drink compounded for him by Margaret, till Dunning came,pale, too, and excited, whispering to Mrs. Osborne that the doctor wasto come directly, and that there was no change, before he approached hismaster, with whom, a few minutes afterwards, he was heard talking, andeven laughing, by the Colonel, who remained in the library, pacing upand down with the painful embarrassment of a stranger in a new house, inthe midst of a family tragedy, but not knowing what part he had to playin it, or where he should go, or what he should do. Margaret had lefthim without even a good-night, to return to the room upstairs, whereLady Piercey lay motionless and staring, with the red ribbons stillcrowning her awful brow.CHAPTER XVII.And where was Gervase? His mother lay in the same condition all the nextday. There was little hope that she would ever come out of it. Thedoctor said calmly that it was what he had looked for, for a long time.There had been “a stroke” before, though it was slight and had not beentalked about; but Parsons knew very well what he was afraid of, andshould have kept her mistress from excitement. Parsons, too, allowedthat she knew it might come at any time. But Lord! a thing that may comeat any time, you don’t ever think it’s going to come now, Parsons said;and who was she to control her lady as was the head of everything? Itwas allowed on all sides that to control Lady Piercey would have been adifficult thing indeed, especially where anything about Gervase wasconcerned.“Spoiled the boy from the beginning, that was what she always did,” saidSir Giles, mumbling. “I’d have kept a stronger hand over him, Gerald;but what could I do, with his mother making it all up to him, as soon asmy back was turned?”Colonel Piercey heard a great deal about Gervase that he had never beenintended to hear. Lady Piercey’s fiction, which she had made up soelaborately about the young man of fashion, crumbled all to pieces, poorlady; while one after another made their confidences to him. The onlyone who said nothing was Margaret. She was overwhelmed with occupation;all the charge of the house, which Lady Piercey had kept in her ownhands, falling suddenly upon her shoulders, and without any co-operationfrom the much-indulged old servants, who were all servile to theirimperious mistress, but very insubordinate to any government but hers.It became a serious matter, however, as the days passed by, and the oldlady remained like a soul in prison, unable to move or to speak, yetstaring with ever watchful eyes at the door, looking, they all felt, forsome one who did not come. Where was Gervase? There was moretelegraphing at Greyshott than there ever had been since such a thingwas possible. Mr. Gregson replied to say that he had not found Gervaseat the train, and had not seen him, news which brought everything to astandstill. Where, then, had he gone? They had no address to send to, noclue by which he might be traced out. He had disappeared altogether,nobody could tell where. Colonel Piercey’s first impulse had been toleave the distracted family, thus thrown into the depths of domesticdistress, but Sir Giles clung to him with piteous helplessness,imploring him not to go.“After my boy Gervase, there’s nobody but you,” he cried, “and he’saway, God knows where, and whom should I have to hold on by if you wereto go too? There’s Meg, to be sure: but she’s got enough to do with mylady. Stay, Gerald, stay, for goodness’ sake. I’ve nobody, nobody, on myside of the house but you; and if anything were to happen,” cried thepoor old gentleman, breaking down, “who have I to give orders, or to seeto things? I don’t know what is to become of me if you won’t stay.”“I’ll stay, of course, Uncle Giles, if I can be of any use,” saidColonel Piercey.“God bless you, my lad!” cried Sir Giles, now ready to sob forsatisfaction, as he had before been for trouble. “Now I can face things,if I’ve you to stand by me.”The household in general took heart when it was known he was to stay.“Oh! Colonel Piercey, if you’d but look up Mr. Gervase for my lady?--shecan’t neither die nor get better till she sees her boy,” said theweeping Parsons; and “Colonel Piercey, Sir,” said Dunning, “Sir Giles dolook to you so, as he never looked to any gentleman before. I’ll get himto do whatever’s right and good for him if so be as he knows you’rehere.” Thus, both master and servants seized upon him. And yet whatcould he do? He could not go out and search for Gervase whom he hadnever seen, knowing absolutely nothing of his cousin’s haunts, nor ofthe people among whom he was likely to be. And he could not consult theservants on this point. There was but one person who could give himinformation, and she kept out of his way.On the evening of the second day, however, Margaret came into thelibrary after Sir Giles had been wheeled off to bed. It happened thatColonel Piercey was standing before the writing-table, examining thatvery photograph which he had discovered with such surprise, and whichhad made him break off so quickly in his story on the night when LadyPiercey was taken ill. She came suddenly up to him where he stood withthe photograph, and laid her hand on his arm. He had not heard her step,and started, almost dropping it in his surprise. “Mrs. Osborne!” heexclaimed.“You are looking at Gervase’s picture? Cousin Gerald, help us if youcan. I don’t know how much or how little she feels, but it is Gervase myaunt is lying looking for--Gervase, who doesn’t know she is ill even ifhe had the thought. Was it him you saw with--with the woman? I have notliked to ask you, but I can’t put it off any longer. Was it Gervase? Oh!for pity’s sake, speak!”“How should I know,” he said, “if you don’t know?”“Know? I! What way have I of knowing? You saw him, or you seemed tothink you did.”“It was only for a moment. I had never seen him before; I might bemistaken. It seemed to me that it was the same kind of face. But how canI speak on the glimpse of a moment? I might be quite wrong.”“You are very cautious,” she cried at last, “oh, very cautious!--thoughit is a matter of life and death. Won’t you help us, then, or can’t youhelp us? If this is so, it might give a clue. There is a girl--who hasdisappeared also, I have just found out. Oh! Cousin Gerald, you knowwhat he is?--you must have heard enough to know: not a madman, nor evenan imbecile, yet not like other people. He might be imposed upon--hemight be carried away. There was something strange about him before hewent. He said things which I could not understand. But they suspectednothing.”“Was it not your duty,” said Gerald Piercey, almost sternly, “to tellthem--if they suspected nothing, as you say?”“You speak to me very strangely,” she said with a forced smile; “as if Iwere in the wrong, anyhow. What could I tell them? That I was uneasy,and not satisfied? My aunt would have asked what did it matter if I weresatisfied or not?--and Uncle Giles!” She stopped, and resumed in adifferent tone, “And the girl has gone up to London from the SevenThorns--so far as I can make out, on the same day.”“What sort of a girl?”Margaret described her as well as she was able.“I cannot give you many details. I think she is pretty: brown hair andeyes, very neat and nice in her dress, though my aunt thinks it beyondher station. I think, on the whole, a nice-looking girl--not tall.”“The description would answer most young women that one sees.”“It is possible--there is nothing remarkable. She looks clever andwatchful, and a little defiant. But I did not mean you to go into thestreets to look for Patty. I thought you might see whether mydescription agreed.”“Mrs. Osborne, perhaps you will tell me what you suppose to havehappened, and what there is that I can do.”“If we are to be on such formal terms,” said Margaret, colouring deeply,“yes, Colonel Piercey, I will tell you. I suppose, or rather, I fear,that Gervase may have gone away with Patty Hewitt. She is quite arespectable girl. She would not compromise herself; therefore----”“You think he has married her?”“I think most likely she must have married him--or intends to do it. Butthat takes time. They could not have banns called, or other arrangementsmade----”“They could have a special licence.”“Ah! but that costs money. They would not have money, either of them. Ihave been trying to make inquiries quietly. But time is passing, and hispoor mother! It would be better to consent to anything,” said Margaret,“than to have her die without seeing him; and perhaps if he were found,the pressure on the brain might relax. No, I don’t know if that ispossible; I am no doctor. I only want to satisfy her. She is his mother!Whatever he is, he is more to her than any one else in the world.”“She does not seem very kind to you, that you should think so much ofthat.”“Who said she was not kind to me? You take a great deal upon yourself,Colonel Piercey, to be a distant cousin!”“I am the next-of-kin,” he said. “I’d like to protect these poor oldpeople--and it is my duty--from any plot there may be against them.”“Plot--against them?” She stared at him for a moment with eyes thatdilated with astonishment. Then she shook her head.“I don’t know what you mean,” she said. “If you will not help, I must dowhat I can by myself. And you are free on your side to inquire, and Ihope will do it, and take such steps as may seem to you good. The thingnow is to find Gervase for his mother. At another moment,” saidMargaret, raising her head, “you will perhaps explain to me what youmean by this tone--towards me.”She turned her back upon him without another word, and walked away,leaving Colonel Piercey not very comfortable. He asked himself uneasilywhat right he had to suspect her?--what he suspected her of?--as hestood and watched her crossing the hall. It was a sign of the agitationin the house, that all the doors seemed to stand open, the centre of thefamily existence having shifted somehow from the principal roomsdownstairs to some unseen room above, where the mistress of the houselay. What did he suspect Meg Piercey of? What had he against her? Whenhe asked himself this, it appeared that all he had against her was thatshe was a dependent, a widow, a middle-aged person--one of those wreckswhich encumber the shores of life, which ought to have gone down, or tobe broken up, not to strew the margins of existence with unnecessary andincapable things, making demands upon feeling and sympathy which mightbe much better expended elsewhere. Colonel Piercey was not a hard man bynature: he was, in fact, rather too open to the claims of charity, andhad expended too much, not too little, upon widows and orphans in hisday. But it had stirred up all the angry elements in his nature to seeMeg Piercey in that condition which was not natural to her. She ought tohave died long ago along with her husband, or she ought to have aposition of her own: to see her here in that posture of dependence, inthat black gown, with that child, living, as he said to himself harshly,upon charity, and accepting all the penalties, was more than he couldbear. There is a great deal to be said for the Suttee, though ahumanitarian government has put an end to it. It is so much moredignified for a woman. To a man of fine feelings, it is a painful thingto see how a person whose natural rôle is that of a princess, adispenser of help to others, should come down herself into the rank ofthe beggar, because of the death of, probably, a very inferior being towhom she was married. It degraded her altogether in the scale of being.A princess has noble qualities, large aims, and stands above thecrowd--a dependant does quite the reverse. Scheming and plotting are thenatural breath of the latter; and that a woman should let herself comedown to that wilfully, rather than die and be done with it, which wouldbe so much more natural and dignified! Colonel Piercey was aware thathis thoughts were very fantastic, and yet this is how they were--hecould not help himself. He was angry with Margaret. It was not the placeshe was born to; a sort of Abigail about the backstairs, existing by thecaprice of a disagreeable old woman. Oh, no! it was not a thing that aman could put up with. And, of course, she must have sunk to the levelof her kind.This was why he suspected her. The question remained, What did hesuspect her of? And this was still more difficult to answer. Such awoman, of course, would live by sowing mischief in a family; by hurtingin the most effectual way the superiors who kept her down, and were solittle considerate of her. And their son was the way in which she couldmost effectively do this. Gerald Piercey had various thoughts rising inhis mind about this young man, who probably was not at all fit to holdthe family property and succeed Sir Giles in its honours. There was onepoint of view from which Colonel Piercey could not forget that hehimself was the next-of-kin--that which made him, in his own eyes, thechampion of Gervase--his determined defender against every assault.Perhaps the very strength of this feeling might push him beyond what wasright and just; but it would be in the way of supporting and protectinghis weak-minded cousin. That was a point upon which, naturally, he couldhave no doubt. If Meg Piercey was against him, it was Gerald Piercey’spart to defend him. But the means were a little doubtful. He was notclear whether Meg was helping Gervase to marry unsuitably, to spite hisparents, or whether her intention was to prevent this marriage, in orderto deprive him of his happiness and the natural protection which thesupport of a clever wife might afford to the half-witted young man.Thus, he had a difficult part to play; having first to find out whatMargaret’s scope and meaning was, and then to set himself to defeat it.He had been but three days in the house, and what a tangled web he wasinvolved in!--to be the Providence of all these people, old and young,whom he knew so little, yet was so closely connected with; and to defeatthe evil genius, the enemy in the guise of a friend, whom he alone wasclear-sighted enough to divine. But she puzzled him all the same. Shehad looks that were not those of a deceiver; and when she had raised herhead and told him that at another moment she would demand an explanationof what his tone meant, something like a shade of alarm passed throughthe soldier’s mind. He would not have been alarmed, you may be sure, ifMargaret had threatened him with a champion, as in the older days.Bois-Guilbert was not afraid of Ivanhoe. But, when it is the womanherself who asks an explanation, and his objections have to be stated infull words, to her alone, facing him for herself, that is a differentmatter. It may well make a man look pale.CHAPTER XVIII.The next morning after this, Gerald Piercey found himself in the frontof the Seven Thorns. He had not known what it was: whether a hamlet, ora farm, or what he actually found it to be, a roadside inn. The aspectof the place was more attractive than usual. It was lying full in themorning sunshine; a great country waggon, with its white covering, andfine, heavily-built, but well-groomed horses, standing before the door,concentrating the light in its great hood. One of the horses was white,which made it a still more shining object in the midst of the red-brownroad. The old thorns were full in the sunshine, which softened theirshabby antiquity, and made the gnarled roots and twisted branchespicturesque. The long, low fabric of the house was bathed in the samelight, which pervaded the whole atmosphere with a purifying andembellishing touch. The west side, looking over the walled garden, whichextended for some distance along the road, though in the shade, showed arow of open windows, at which white curtains fluttered, giving an air ofinhabitation to that usually-closed-up portion of the place. The visitorfelt, as he looked at it, that it was not a mere village public-house,that its decadence might have a story, and that it was possible that thedaughter of such a house might not, after all, be a mere rusticcoquette, or, perhaps, so bad a match for the half-witted Gervase.Colonel Piercey had never once thought of himself as the possible heirof Greyshott; he did not feel that he had any interest in keepingGervase from marrying, and though it was intolerable that the heir ofthe Pierceys should marry a barmaid, his feelings softened as he lookedat the old country inn, with its look of long-establishment. Probablythere was a farm connected with it; perhaps there was a certain pride offamily here, too, and the daughter of the house was kept apart from thedrinking and the wayside guests. Meg Piercey might have divined that theyoung woman was really the best match that Gervase could hope for, andthis might be the cause of her opposition. (He forgot that he hadsupposed it likely that Meg might be bringing the match about for herown private ends, one hypothesis being just as likely as another.) Withthis idea he approached slowly, and took his seat upon the bench thatstood under the window of the parlour. The roads between Greyshott andthe Seven Thorns were dry and dusty, and his boots were white enough towarrant the idea that he was a pedestrian reposing himself, naturally,at the place of refreshment on the roadside.The landlord came to the door with the waggoner, when Colonel Pierceyhad established himself there, and his aspect could not be said to bequite equal to that of his house. Hewitt had a red nose and a wateryeye. His appearance did not inspire respect. He was holding the waggonerby the breast of his smock, and holding forth, duly emphasising hisdiscourse by the gesture of the other hand, in which he held a pipe.“You just ’old by me,” he was saying, “look’ee, Jack; and I’ll ’old byyou, I will. The ’ay’s a good crop; nobody can’t say nothing again that.But there’s rain a-coming, and Providence, ’e knows what’ll come of itall in the end. It ain’t what’s grow’d in the fields as is to be trustedto, but what’s safe in the stacks; and there’s a deal o’ differencebetween one and the other. Look’ee here! you ’old by me, and I’ll ’oldby you. And I can’t speak no fairer. I’ve calcilated all round, I’ave--me and Patty, my girl, as is that good at figures; and if it’s gotin safe, all as I’ve got to say is, that this ’ere will be a dasheduncommon yeer.”“It’s mostly the way,” said the waggoner, “I’ll allow, with them dryJunes. The weather can’t ’old up not for ever.”“Nor won’t,” said old Hewitt, with assurance; “it stands to reason.Ain’t this a variable climate or ain’t it not? And a drop o’ rain we’aven’t seen not for three weeks and more. Then we’ll ’ave a wet July.You see yourself when I knocked the glass ’ow it went down. And that,”he added, triumphantly, waving his pipe in the air, “is what settles theprice of the ’ay.”“I shouldn’t wonder if you was right, master,” said the waggoner,getting under weigh.Gerald Piercey sat and watched the big horses straining their greatflanks to the work, setting the heavy waggon in motion, with pleasure inthe sight which diverted him for a moment from his chief object ofinterest. Coming straight from India and the fine and slender-limbedcreatures which are the patricians of their kind, the great, patient,phlegmatic English cart-horse filled him with admiration. The bigfeathered hoofs, the immense strain of those gigantic hind-quarters, thesteady calm of the rustic, reflected with a greater and more dignifiedimpassiveness in the face of his beast, was very attractive andinteresting to him.“Fine horses, these,” he said, half to Hewitt at the door, half to thewaggoner, who grinned with a slow shamefacedness, as if it were himselfwho was being praised.“Ay, sir,” said Hewitt, “and well took care of, as ever beasts was. JackMason there--though I say it as shouldn’t--is awfull good to his team.”“And why shouldn’t you say it?” said Colonel Piercey. “It’s clearenough.”“He’s a relation, that young man is, and it’s a country saying, sir, asyou shouldn’t speak up for your own. But I ain’t one as pays much ’eedto that, for, says I, you knows them that belong to you better nor anyone else does. There’s my girl Patty, now; there ain’t one like herbetwixt Guildford and Portsmouth, and who knows it as well as me?”“That’s a very satisfactory state of things,” said the visitor, “and, ofcourse, you must know best. But I fear you won’t be able to keep MissPatty long to yourself if she’s like that.”At this Patty’s father began to laugh a slow, inward laugh. “There’s’eaps o’ fellows after ’er, like bees after a ’oney ’ive. But, Lordbless you! she don’t think nothing o’ them. She’s not one as would takeup with a country ’Odge. She’s blood in her veins, has my girl. We’vebeen at the Seven Thorns, off and on, for I don’t know ’ow many ’undredyears: more time,” said Hewitt, waving his pipe vaguely towardsGreyshott, “than them folks ’as been at the ’All.”“Ah, indeed! That’s the Pierceys, I suppose?”“And a proud set they be. But ’Ewitts was ’ere before ’em, only theywon’t acknowledge it. I’ve ’eard my sister Patience, ’as ’ad a terribletongue of ’er own, tell Sir Giles so to his face. ’E was young then, andfather couldn’t keep ’im out o’ this ’ouse. After Patience, to be sure;but he was a terrible cautious one, was Sir Giles, and it never come tonought.” The landlord laughed with a sharp hee-hee-hee. “I reckon,” hesaid, “it runs in the blood.”“What runs in the blood?”“I don’t know, sir,” said the innkeeper, pausing suddenly, “if you’vecalled for anything? I can’t trust neither to maid nor man to attend tothe customers now Patty’s away.”“If you have cider, I should like a bottle, and perhaps you’ll help meto drink it,” said Colonel Piercey. “I’m sorry to hear that Miss Patty’saway.”“In London,” said Hewitt; “but only for a bit. She ’as a ’ead, that chit’as! Them rooms along there, end o’ the ’ouse, ’asn’t been lived in notfor years and years. She says to me, she does, ‘Father, let’s clear ’emout, and maybe we’ll find a lodger.’ I was agin it at first. ‘What’llyou do with a lodger? There ain’t but very little to be made o’ that,’ Isays. ‘They don’t come down to the parlour to drink, that sort doesn’t,and they’re more trouble nor they’re worth.’ ‘You leave it to me,father,’ she says. And, if you’ll believe it, she’s found folks for themrooms already! New-married folks, she says, as will spend their moneyfree. And coming in a week, for the rest of the summer or more. That’sPatty’s way!” cried the landlord, smiting his thigh. “Strike while it’s’ot, that’s ’er way! Your good ’ealth, sir, and many of ’em. It ain’t mybrewing, that cider. I gets it from Devonshire, and I think, beggingyour pardon, sir, as it’s ’eady stuff.”“But how,” said Colonel Piercey, “will you manage with your visitors,when your daughter is away?”“Oh, bless you, sir, she’s a-coming with ’em, she says in her letter, ifnot before. Patty knows well I ain’t the one for lodgers. I sits in myown parlour, and I don’t mind a drop to drink friendly-like with e’er aman as is thirsty, or to see a set of ’orses put up in my stables, orthat; but Richard ’Ewitt of the Seven Thorns ain’t one to beck and bowafore folks as thinks themselves gentry, and maybe ain’t not ’alf asgood as ’er and me. No, sir; I wasn’t made, nor was my father afore memade, for the likes of that.”“It is very good of you, I’m sure, Mr. Hewitt, to sit for half an hourwith me, who may be nobody, as you say.”“Don’t mention it, sir,” said Hewitt, with a wave of the pipe which hestill carried like a banner in his hand: “I ’ope I knows a gentlemanwhen I sees one; and as I said, I sits at my own door and I takes afriendly drop with any man as is thirsty. That ain’t the same as bowingand scraping, and taking folks’s orders, as is nothing to me.”“And Miss Patty, you say, is in London? London’s a big word: is she eastor west, or----”“It’s funny,” said Hewitt, “the interest that’s took in my Patty sinceshe’s been away. There’s been Sally Ferrett, the nurse up at Greyshott,asking and asking, where is she, and when did she go, and when she’scoming back? I caught her getting it all out of ’Lizabeth the girl. Whatday did she go, and what train, and so forth? ’Lizabeth’s a gaby. Shejust says ‘Yes, Miss,’ and ‘No, Miss,’ to a wench like that, as is onlya servant like herself. I give it ’em well, and I give Miss her answer.‘What’s their concern up at Greyshott with where my Patty is?”“That’s true,” said Colonel Piercey, “and what is my concern? You arequite right, Mr. Hewitt.”“Oh, yours, sir? that’s different: you ask out o’ pure idleness, you do,to make conversation; I understand that. But between you and me Icouldn’t answer ’em, not if I wanted to. For my Patty is one as can takevery good care of ’erself, and she don’t give me no address. She’ll beback with them young folks, or maybe, afore ’em, next week, and that’sall as I want to know. I wants her then, for I’ll not have nothing to dowith ’em, and ’Lizabeth, she’s a gaby, and not to be trusted. Lodgers inmy opinion is more trouble than they’re any good. So Patty will managethem herself, or they don’t come here.”“The family at Greyshott takes an interest in your daughter, I presume,from what you say,” said Colonel Piercey.Upon this Hewitt laughed low and long, and winked over and over againwith his watery eye. “There’s one of ’em as does,” he said. “Oh, there’sone of ’em as does! If so be as you know the family, sir, you’ll knowthe young gentleman. Don’t you know Mr. Gervase?--eh, not the young ’un,sir, as is Sir Giles’s heir? Oh, Lord, if you don’t know him you don’tknow Greyshott Manor, nor what’s going on there.”“I have never seen the young gentleman,” said Gerald; “I believe he isnot very often at home.”“I don’t know about ’ome, but ’e’s ’ere as often as ’e can be. ’E’d be’ere mornin’, noon, and night if I’d ’a put up with it; but I see ’im,what ’e was after, and I’ll not ’ave my girl talked about, not for thebest Piercey as ever trod in shoe-leather. And ’e ain’t the best, oh,not by a long chalk ’e ain’t. Sir Giles is dreadful pulled down with therheumatics and that, but ’e was a man as was something like a man. Lordbless you, sir, this poor creature, ’e’s a Softy, and ’e’ll never be nomore.”“What do you mean by a Softy?” said Gerald, quickly; then he added witha sensation of shame, “Never mind, I don’t want you to tell me. Don’tyou think you should be a little more careful what you say, when a youngman like this comes to your house?”“What should I be careful for?” said Hewitt; “I ain’t noways beholdin’to the Pierceys. They ain’t my landlords, ain’t the Piercey’s, thoughthey give themselves airs with their Lords o’ the Manor, and all that.Hewitts of the Seven Thorns is as good as the Pierceys, and notbeholdin’ to them, not for the worth of a brass fardin--oh, no! And Iwouldn’t have the Softy about my house, a fool as opens ’is mouth andlaughs in your face if you say a sensible word to ’im; not for me!Richard Hewitt’s not a-going to think twice what he says for a fool like’im. Softy’s ’is name and Softy’s ’is nature: ask any man in the villagewho the Softy is, and they’ll soon tell you. Lord, it don’t matter abit what I say.”“Still, I suppose,” said Colonel Piercey, feeling a little nettled inspite of himself, “it is, after all, the first family in theneighbourhood.”“First family be dashed,” cried Hewitt; “I’m as good a family as any of’em. And I don’t care that, no, not that,” he cried, snapping hisfingers, “for the Pierceys, if they was kings and queens, which theyain’t, nor no such big folks after all. Old Sir Giles, he’s most goneoff his head with rheumatics and things; and my lady, they do say, she’ave ’ad a stroke, and serve her right for her pride and her pryin’. AndMr. Gervase, he’s a Softy, and that’s all that’s to be said. They ain’tmuch for a first family when you knows all the rights and the wrongs ofit,” Hewitt said.CHAPTER XIX.The poet’s wish that we might see ourselves as others see us was, thoughhe did not so intend it, a cruel wish. It might save us some ridicule tothe outside world, but it would turn ourselves and our pretensions intosuch piteous ridicule to ourselves, that life would be furnished withnew pangs. Colonel Piercey went back to Greyshott with a sense of thiskeen truth piercing through all appearances, which was half ludicrousand half painful, though it was not himself, but his relations, that hadbeen exhibited to him in the light of an old rustic’s observations. Hehad come upon this visit with a sense of the greatness of the head ofhis own family, which had, perhaps, a little self-esteem in it; for ifthe younger branches of the house were what he knew them in his ownperson, and his father’s, what ought not the head of the house, SirGiles, the lineal descendant of so many Sir Gileses, and young Gervase,the heir of those long-unbroken honours, to be? He had expected, perhapsa little solemn stupidity, such as the younger is apt to associate withthe elder branch. But he had also expected something ofgreatness--evidence that the house was of that reigning race which iscosmopolitan, and recognises its kind everywhere from English meads toStyrian mountains, and even among the chiefs of the East. It wasludicrous to see, through the eyes of a clown, how poor, after all,these pretences were. Yet he could not help it. Poor old Sir Giles,helpless and querulous, broken down by sickness, and, perhaps,disappointment and trouble; the poor old lady, not much at any time ofthe rural princess she might have been, lying speechless in thatlingering agony of imprisoned consciousness; and the son, the heir, thefuture head of the house! Was not that a revelation to stir the blood inthe veins of Gerald Piercey, the next-of-kin? He was a man of manyfaults, but he was full both of pride and generosity. The humiliationfor his race struck him more than any possible elevation for himself.Indeed, that possible elevation was far enough off, if he had everthought of it. A half-witted rustic youth, taken hold of by a pertbarmaid, with a numerous progeny to follow, worthy of both sides--wasthat what the Pierceys were to come to in the next generation? He hadnever thought, having so many other things to occupy him in his life, ofthat succession, though probably he began to think, his father had, whohad so much insisted on this visit. But what a succession it would benow! He was walking along, turning these things over in his mind, goingslowly, and not much observant (though this was not at all his habit) ofwhat was about him, when he was sensible of a sudden touch, which was,indeed, only upon his hand, yet which felt as if it had been direct uponhis heart, rousing all kinds of strange sensations there. It was a thingwhich is apt to touch every one susceptible of feeling, with quick andunexpected sensations when it comes unawares. It was a little hand--verysmall, very soft, very warm, yet with a grasp in it which held fast,suddenly put into his hand. Colonel Piercey stopped, touched, as I havesaid, on his very heart, which, underneath all kinds of actual andconventional coverings, was soft and open to emotion. He looked down andsaw a little figure at his foot, a little glowing face looking up athim. “May I tum and walk with you, Cousin Colonel?” a small voice said.“Sally, do away.”“Certainly you shall come and walk with me, Osy,” said the Colonel.“What are you doing, little man, so far from home?”“It’s not far from home. I walks far--far--further than that. Sally, doaway! I’m doing to walk home with a gemplemans. I’m a gemplemans myself,but Movver will send a woman wif me wherever I do. Sally, do away!”“I’ll take care of him,” said Colonel Piercey, with a nod to the maid.“And so you think you’re too big for a nurse, Master Osy. How old areyou?”“Seven,” said the boy; “at least I’m more than six-and-three-quarters,Cousin Colonel. Little Joey at the farm is only five, and he does miles,all by hisself. Joey is better than me many ways,” he added,thoughtfully; “he dets up on the big hay-cart, and he wides on the bighorse, and his faver sits him up high! on his so’lder. But I only havea pony and sometimes I does with Jacob in the dog-cart, andsometimes----”“Would you like to ride on my shoulder, Osy?”Osy looked up to the high altitude of that shoulder with a look full ofdeliberation, weighing various things. “I s’ould like it,” he said, “butI felled off once when Cousin Gervase put me up, and I promised Movver:but I tan’t help it when he takes me by my arms behind me. Sometimes I’mfwightened myself. A gemplemans oughtn’t to be fwightened, s’ould he,Cousin Colonel?”“That depends,” said Gerald. “I am a great deal bigger than you, butsometimes I have been frightened, too.”Osy looked at the tall figure by his side with certain glimmerings inhis eyes of contempt. That size! and afraid!--but he would not make anyremark. One does not talk of the deficiencies of others when one is oftruly gentle spirit. One passes them over. He apologised like a princeto Gerald for himself. “That would be,” he said, “when it was a big, biggiant. There’s giants in India, I know, like Goliath. If I do to Indiawhen I’m a man, I’ll be fwightened, too.”“But David wasn’t, you know, Osy.”“That’s what I was finking, Cousin Colonel, but he flinged the stone athim before he tummed up to him. Movver says it was quite fair, but----”“I think it was quite fair. Don’t you see, he had his armour on, and hisshield, and all that; if he had had his wits about him, he might haveput up his shield to ward off the stone. When you are little you must bevery sharp.”Osy looked at his big cousin again, reflectively. “I don’t fink I couldkill you, Cousin Colonel, even if I was very sharp.”“I hope not, Osy, and I trust you will never want to, my little man.”“I would if we was fighting,” said Osy, with spirit; “but I’ll do ondetting bigger and bigger till I’m a man: and you are a man now, and youtan’t gwow no more.”“You bloodthirsty little beggar! You’ll go on getting bigger and biggerwhile I shall grow an old man like Uncle Giles.”“I never,” cried Osy, flushing very red, “would stwike an old gemplemanslike Uncle Giles. Never! I wouldn’t let nobody touch him. When CousinGervase runned away with his chair, I helped old Dunning to stop him.You might kill me, but I would fight for Uncle Giles!”“It appears you are going to be a soldier, anyhow, Osy.”“My faver was a soldier,” said Osy. “Movver’s got his sword hanging upin our room; all the rest of the fings belongs to Uncle Giles, but thesword, it belongs to Movver and me.”The Colonel gave the little hand which was in his an involuntarypressure, and a little moisture came into the corner of his eye. “Do youremember your father,” he said, “my little man?”Osy shook his head. “I don’t remember nobody but Movver,” the childsaid.What a curious thing it was! To hear of the dead father and his swordbrought that wetness to Colonel Piercey’s eye; but the name of themother, which filled all the child’s firmament, dried the half-tear likemagic. The poor fellow who had died went to the Colonel’s heart. Thelonely woman with the little boy, so much more usual an occasion ofsentiment, did not touch him at all. He did not want to hear anything of“Movver”: and, indeed, Osy was by no means a sentimental child, and hadno inclination to enlarge on the theme. His mother was a matter ofcourse to him, as to most healthy little boys: to enlarge upon her loveor her excellencies was not at all in his way.“You walk very fast, Cousin Colonel,” was the little fellow’s nextremark.“Do I, my little shaver? What a beast I am, forgetting your small legs.Come, jump and get up on my shoulder, Osy.”Osy looked up with mingled pleasure and alarm. “I promised Movver: butif you holded me very fast----”“Oh, I’ll hold you. You mustn’t be frightened, Osy.”“Me fwightened! But I felled down and hurted my side, and fwightenedMovver. Huwah! huwah!” shouted the child. “I’m not fwightened a bit,Cousin Colonel! You holds me and I holds you, and you may canter, orgallop, or anyfing. I’ll never be afwaid.”“Here goes, then,” said the grave soldier. And with shouts and laughterthe pair rushed on, Colonel Piercey enjoying the race as much as thechild on his shoulder, who urged him with imaginary spurs, very dusty ifnot very dangerous, holding fast with one hand by the collar of hiscoat. He had not much experience of children, and the confidence andaudacity of this little creature, his glee, his warm grip, in whichthere was a touch of terror, and his wild enjoyment at once of themovement and the danger, aroused a new sentiment in the heart of themature man, who had known none of the emotions of paternity. Suddenly,however, a change came over his spirit: he reduced his pace, he ceasedto laugh, he sank all at once--though with the child still shouting onhis shoulder, endeavouring, with his little kicks upon his breast, torouse him to further exertions--into the ordinary gravity of his aspectand demeanour. There had appeared suddenly out of the little gate of thebeech avenue, a figure, which took all the fun out of Gerald Piercey,though he could not have told why.“Movver, movver! look here: I’m up upon my horse. But you needn’t befwightened, for he’s not like Cousin Gervase. He’s holded me fast, fastall the way.”“Oh! Osy,” cried Margaret, holding her breath--for, indeed, it was aremarkable sight to see the unutterable gravity of Colonel Pierceyendeavouring solemnly to take off his hat to her, with the child,flushed and delighted, upon his shoulder. There was something comic inthe extreme seriousness which had suddenly fallen upon Osy’s bearer.“You are making yourself a bore to Colonel Piercey,” she said.“Not at all; we have been enjoying ourselves very much. He is adelightful companion,” said Gerald, but in a tone which suggested asevere despair. “Will you get down, Osy, or would you rather I shouldcarry you home?”“I would wather----” said the child, and then he paused. “I tan’t seeyour face,” he said, pettishly, “but you feels twite different, as ifyou was tired. I fink I’ll get down.”Colonel Piercey’s comment to himself was that the child was frightenedfor his mother, but, naturally, he did not express this sentiment. Helifted Osy down and set him on the ground. “Where’s the nurse now?” hesaid; “a long way behind. You see, Osy, it’s good to have a basis tofall back upon when new operations are ordered by the ruling powers.”Could the man not refrain from a gibe at her, even to her child,Margaret thought, with wonder? But she was surprised to see that hestood still, as if with the intention of speaking to her.“You are going out?” he said, in his solemn tones. “Is Lady Pierceybetter?”“She is no better; but I must attempt, in some way, to get the newsconveyed to Gervase. Her eyes turn constantly to the door. They arestill quite living, though not so strong. She must see him, if it ispossible. She _must_ see him, if there is any way--her only child.”“But not, from all I hear, a child that does her much credit,” he said.“What does that matter? He is all she has,” she added hastily. “Don’tlet me detain you, Colonel Piercey. I must not be gone long; and I musttry if anything can be done.”“You mean that I am detaining you,” he said, turning with her. “And Ihave something to tell you, if I may walk with you. I have been talkingto old Hewitt, of the Seven Thorns. He says he has no address tocommunicate with his daughter; but there is a newly-married couplecoming to occupy his rooms, and that she is returning with them nextweek.”“A newly-married couple!” cried Margaret, aghast. “Can it be they? Canit be Patty? Is it possible?”“I thought it might be so, if it was he and she whom I saw.”“Oh, his mother! his mother! And this was what she was most afraid of.Why, why did she let him go.”“Yes, why did she let him go, if she were so much afraid to this, as youthink? But, perhaps you are alarming yourself unnecessarily? LadyPiercey must have known tolerably well at his age what her son waslikely to do?”“Yes, I am perhaps alarming myself unnecessarily. The chances are shewill not live to see it. It is only she who would feel it much. PoorAunt Piercey! Why should one wish her to live to hear this?” Margaretpaused a little, wringing her hands, uncertain whether to turn back orto proceed. At last she said to herself, “Anyhow, she wants him--shewants him. If it is possible, she must see her boy;” and went on againquickly, scarcely noticing the dark figure at her side. But he did notchoose to be overlooked.“I should like,” he said, “to have a few things explained. You saynobody would mind this marriage--if it is a marriage--except LadyPiercey?”“I said nobody would mind it much. My uncle would get used to it, and hecould be talked over: and Patty Hewitt is a clever girl. But AuntPiercey----!”“Why should she stand out?”“If you do not understand,” cried Margaret, “how can I tell you? Hismother! and a woman that has always hoped better things, and thoughtstill, if he married well,---- You forget,” she cried vehemently, “thatpoor Gervase was not to her what he was to us. He was her only child! Amother may see everything even more keenly than others; but you hope,you always hope----”“I presume, then, you did not think so? You did not object to thismarriage.”“What does it matter whether I objected or not? Of what consequence ismy opinion? None of us can like it. A girl like Patty to be at the headof Greyshott! Oh! who could like that? But,” said Margaret more calmly,“my poor aunt deceives herself; for what nice girl, unless she wereforced, as girls are sometimes, would marry Gervase? Poor Gervase! It isnot his fault. She deceives herself. But I don’t think she will live tosee it. I don’t think she will live to hear of it. If she could onlyhave him by her before she dies. Patty could not oppose herself to that.She could not prevent that.”“Is it supposed, then, that she would wish to do so?”“Colonel Piercey,” cried Margaret, “you have come among us at a dreadfulmoment, when all the secrets of the family are laid bare. Oh, don’t askany more questions! I have said things I did not intend to say.”“I hope that I am to be trusted,” he said, with his severe tone; “and ifI can help, I will. To whom are you going? Is it to this old Hewitt? fornothing, I think, is to be learned from him.”“I am going to Miss Hewitt, her aunt. It is in despair. For she has ahatred of all of us at Greyshott; but surely, surely, when they hearthat his mother is dying----”“She cannot hate me. I will go,” Gerald Piercey said.CHAPTER XX.Old Miss Hewitt sat in her parlour, if not like a fat spider watchingfor the fly, at least like a large cat seated demurely, with an eye uponher natural prey, though her aspect was more decorous and composed thanwords could tell. She had been made aware by her little servant a fewminutes before that “a gentleman” was coming up to the door, and hadinstantaneously prepared to meet the visitor. A visitor was a very rarething at Rose Cottage.“You’re sure it ain’t the curate, a-coming begging?”“Oh, no,” cried the little maid, “a tall, grand gentleman, like a lord.I think I knows a pa’son when I sees ’un!” she added, with rusticcontempt. Miss Hewitt settled herself in her large chair; she gave hercap that twist that every woman who wears a cap supposes to put allaright. She drew to her a footstool for her feet, and then she said,“You may let him in, Jane.” A smile of delight was upon her mouth; butshe subdued even that in her sense of propriety, to heighten the effect.She had been waiting for this moment for thirty years. She had not knownhow it would come about, but she had always felt it must come aboutsomehow. She had paid fifty pounds for it--and she had not grudged hermoney--and now it had come. She did not even know the shape it wouldtake, or who it was who was coming to place the family of Piercey at herfeet, that she might spurn them; but that this was what was about tohappen, she felt absolutely sure. It could not be Sir Giles himself,which would have been the sweetest of all, for Sir Giles was too infirmto visit anybody; while she, whom he had scorned once, was hale andstrong, and sure to see both of them out! Perhaps it was a solicitor, orsomething of the kind. What did she care? It was some one from thePierceys coming to her, abject, with a petition--which she would notgrant--no, not if they besought her on their knees.The room seemed in semi-darkness to Gerald, coming in from thebrightness of the summer afternoon. The blind was drawn down to save thecarpet, and the curtains hung heavily over the window for gentility’ssake. Miss Hewitt sat with her back to the light, by the side of thefireplace, which was filled up by cut paper. There was no air in theroom; and though Colonel Piercey was not a man of humorous perceptions,there occurred even to him the idea of a large cat with her tail curledround her, sitting demure, yet fierce, on the watch for some prey, ofwhich she had scent or sight.“My name is Piercey,” said the Colonel. “I am a relation of the familyat Greyshott, who perhaps, you may have heard, are in great trouble atthis moment. I have come to you, Miss Hewitt--and I hope you will pardonme for disturbing you--to know whether, by any chance, you could furnishus with Gervase Piercey’s address.”“Ah, you’re from the Pierceys,” said Miss Hewitt. “I thought asmuch--though there ain’t that friendship between me and the Pierceysthat should make them send to me in their trouble. And what relation mayyou be, if a person might ask?”“I am a cousin; but that is of little importance. The chief thing isthat Mr. Gervase Piercey is absent, and his address is not known. Hismother is ill----”“I heard of that,” said the old lady, drawing a long breath as ofsatisfaction. “She’s a hard one, too, she is. It would be somethingsharp that made her ill. I suppose as she heard----”“She heard nothing. There was no mental cause for her illness, if thatis what you mean. She had been sitting, talking just as usual----”“Oh--h!” cried Miss Hewitt, with an air of disappointment; “then itwasn’t from the shock? And what’s their meaning, then, MisterPiercey--if you call yourself Piercey--in sending to me?”“That is precisely what I can’t tell you,” said Gerald, with muchcandour. “I confess that it seems absurd, but I supposed, perhaps, thatyou would know.”“And why should it seem absurd? I know a deal more about the Pierceysthan you think for, or any fine gentleman that comes questioning of me,as if I were an old hag in the village. Oh! I know the way that you, ascalls yourselves gentlemen, speak!”“I hope,” said Gerald, surprised, “that I don’t speak in any unbecomingway, or fail in respect to any woman. It is very likely that you knowmuch more than I do, and the question is one that is easily settled.Could you throw any light upon the question where Gervase Piercey is,and if so, will you tell me his address?”She looked at him for a moment as if uncertain how to respond--whetherto play with the victim any longer, or to make a pounce and end it. Thenshe said, quickly, “Did he send you himself?”“Did who send me?”“Giles--Sir Giles; don’t you understand? Was it him as thought ofPatience Hewitt? That’s what I want to know.”“Miss Hewitt, Lady Piercey is very ill----”“Ah! he never was in love with her,” cried the old lady; “never! Hemarried her--he was drawn in to do it; but I know as he hated it when hedid it. It never was for her, if it was he has sent you. Not for her,but for----”She stopped and looked at him again, with a glare in her eyes, yetresolved, apparently, not to pounce but to play a little longer. “Ah! somy lady’s ill, is she? She’s an old woman, more like an old hag, I cantell you, than me. She was thirty-five, if she was a day, when shemarried Sir Giles, and high living and nothing to do has made herdreadful. He never could abear fat women, and it serves him right. Somepeople never lose their figure, whatever their age may be.”She sat very upright in her chair, with a smile of self-complacence,nodding her head. “Well,” she said, “and what’s wanted of me? Not to goand nurse my lady, I suppose? They don’t want me to do that?”“They wish to know,” said Colonel Piercey, restraining himself with aneffort, “Mr. Gervase Piercey’s address.”“Their son’s address?” said Miss Hewitt. “He’s the heir, you know. Thevillage folks calls him the Softy, but there couldn’t nothing be provedagainst him. He’ll be Sir Gervase after his father, and nobody can’tprevent that. And how is it as they don’t know their own son’s address?and for why should they send you to me? Me, a lady living quiet in herown house, meddling with none of them, how should I know their son’saddress?”“I have told you I have not the slightest light to throw on thisquestion. It appears that your niece is in London, and that she wasseen, or it is supposed she was seen, with my cousin.”“And what then?” cried the old lady. “You think, perhaps, as that Softyled my Patty wrong. Ho, ho! ho, ho!” She laughed a low guttural laugh,prolonging it till Colonel Piercey’s exasperation was almost beyondbearing. “You think as he was the gay Lotharium and she was the youngLavinyar, eh? Oh, I’ve read plenty of books in my time, and I know howgentlemen talk of them sort of things. No, she ain’t, Mister Piercey. MyPatty is one that knows very well what she is about.”“So I have heard, also. I believe it is supposed that as he is such afool, your niece may have married him, Miss Hewitt.”“And so she have, just!” cried the old lady, springing from her chair.She waved her arms in the air and uttered a hoarse “Hooray!” “That isjust what has happened, mister; exactly true, as if you’d been in allthe plans from the first. You tell Sir Giles as there is a Patty Hewittwill be Lady Piercey, after all, and not the Queen herself couldn’tprevent it. Just you tell him that from me; Patience, called for heraunt, and thought to be like me, though smaller--my brother being an assand marrying a little woman. But that’s just the gospel truth. She’sMrs. Gervase Piercey, now, and she’ll be Lady Piercey when the timecomes. Oh!” cried Miss Hewitt, sinking back in her chair, exhausted,“but I’d like to be there when he hears. And I’d like to tell her, Ishould,” she added, with a fierce glare in her eyes.Gerald had risen when she did, and stood holding the back of his chair.Fortunately, he had great command of his temper, though the provocationwas strong. He was silent while she settled herself again in her seat,and rearranged her cap-strings and the folds of her gown, though theflowers in her head-dress quivered with excitement and triumph. He said,“I fear you will never have that satisfaction. Lady Piercey is dying,and, happily, knows nothing about this. Perhaps your revenge might bemore complete if you would summon her son to see her before she dies.”Miss Hewitt was too much occupied by what she had herself said to paymuch attention to him. It was only after some minutes of murmuring andsmiling to herself, that she began to recall that he had made a reply.“What was you saying, Mr. Piercey--eh? If you was counting on succeedingyou’re struck all of a heap, and I don’t wonder, for there’s an end ofyou, my fine gentleman! There’ll be a family and a large family, youtake your oath of that. None of your marrying in-and-in cousins andthings, but a fine, fresh, new stock. What was you saying? Dying is she,that woman? Well, we’ve all got to die. She’s had her share above most,and taken other folks’s bread out of their mouths, and she must take hershare now. Nobody’s a-going to die instead of her. That’s a thing asyou’ve got to do when your time comes for yourself.”“And, happily,” said Gerald, “she knows nothing of all this. Perhaps ifshe were permitted to see her son----”“Goodness gracious me!” cried Miss Hewitt, rousing up: “do you hate herlike that? I think you must be the devil himself, to put that into abody’s head. It’s a disappointment to me, dreadful, that she should dieand not know; but to send him to tell her, and the woman at her lastbreath--Oh! Lord, what wickedness there is in this world! Man! whatmakes you hate her like that?”“Will you allow her to see her son?” Colonel Piercey asked.The old woman rose up again in her agitation. One of the old Puritandivines describes Satan as putting so big a stone into the sinner’s handto throw at his enemy, that the bounds of human guilt were over-passedand the almost murderer pitched it at his tempter instead. Thissuggestion was to Patience Hewitt, in the sense in which she understoodit, that too-heavy stone. The desire for revenge had been very strong inher. She had waited and plotted all her life for the opportunity ofreturning to Sir Giles the reward of his desertion of her, and she hadattained her object, and a furious delight was in it. But to seethe thekid in his mother’s milk is a thing about which the most cruel havetheir prejudices. To bring the Softy back to shout his news into the earof the dying woman, that was a more fiendish detail than she had dreamedof. She rose up and sat down again, and clasped her hands and unclaspedthem, and turned over the terrible temptation in her mind. No doubt itwould be the very crown of vengeance, to prove to Sir Giles’ wife thatshe, whom she had supplanted, was the victor at the last. That was whatshe had hoped for all through. She had hoped that it was some rumour ofwhat had happened that had been the cause of Lady Piercey’s illness. Astroke! it was quite natural she should have a stroke when she heard; itwas the vengeance of God long deferred for what she had done unpunishedso many years ago. But between this, in which she felt a grim joy, andthe other, there was a great gulf. To send for Gervase, in order thathe, with his own hand, should give his mother her death-blow, thehorrible thought made her head giddy and her heart beat. It was atemptation--the most dreadful of temptations. It seized upon herimagination even while it filled her with horror. It answered every wilddesire of poetic justice in the untutored mind: never had been anyvengeance like that. It was a thing to be told, and shuddered at, andtold again. “Oh! for goodness gracious sake, go along with you, goalong with you,” she cried, putting out her hands to push the Colonelaway, “for I think you must be the very devil himself.”It was almost with the same words that Gerald Piercey answered Margaret,who met him eagerly as he returned. Sir Giles was out in the garden withDunning and Osy, and there was no one to disturb the consultation ofthese two enemies or friends. “Have you heard anything of him?” criedMargaret. Colonel Piercey answered almost solemnly, “I have seen thedevil; if he ever takes a woman’s form.”“I have heard that she was a dreadful old woman.”“And I have made a dreadful suggestion to her, which she is turning overin her dreadful mind. She hates poor old Lady Piercey with a virulencewhich---- perhaps you may understand it, knowing the circumstances; Idon’t. She is terribly disappointed that it was not the news which wasthe cause of the illness. And I have suggested that if the bridegroomcould be sent home, the old lady might still hear it before she dies.”“The news--the bridegroom! Then it is so? They are married!”“That’s better, I suppose,” said the Colonel, “than if it had beenworse.”Margaret coloured high at this enigmatical speech. “To everybody butAunt Piercey,” she said. “My uncle will get used to the idea; but hismother! It is better he should not come than come to tell her that.”“If he comes we can surely keep him silent,” Colonel Piercey said. “Ithought that was the one thing to be attained at all risks.”“And so it was. And I thank you, Cousin Gerald, and we can but do ourbest.”Lady Piercey turned her eyes towards the door as Margaret went into theroom. A dreadful weariness was in those living eyes, which had notclosed, in anything that could be called sleep, since her seizure. Shehad lain there dead, but for that look, for three days, unable to move afinger. But always her eyes turned to the door whenever it opened,however softly. Sometimes the film of a doze came over them; but no onecame in without meeting that look--the look of a soul in prison, with nosense but that one remaining to make existence a fact. How much she knewof what was passing around her, they could not tell; or of her owncondition, or of what was before her. All she seemed to know was thatGervase did not come. Sometimes her eyes fell upon Margaret with a lookwhich seemed one of angry appeal. And then they returned to watch thedoor, which opened, indeed, from time to time, but never to admit herson. Oh, dreadful eyes! Mrs. Osborne shrank from encountering them. Itwas she, she only of whom they asked that question--she whom they seemedto blame. Where was Gervase? Why did he not come? Was he coming? Speechand hearing were alike gone. Her question was only in her eyes.And thus the evening and the morning made the fourth day.CHAPTER XXI.Patty’s ambitious schemes were crowned with complete success, and thepoor Softy was made the happiest and most triumphant man in the world,on the day on which his mother was taken ill. Was it some mysteriousimpalpable movement in the air that conveyed to Lady Piercey’s brain atroubled impression of what was taking place to her only son? But thisis what no one can tell. As for Gervase, his triumph, his rapture, hissense of emancipation, could not be described. He was wild with pleasureand victory. The sharp-witted, clear-headed girl, who had carried outthe whole plot, was at last overborne and subjugated by the passion shehad roused, and for a time was afraid of Gervase. She had a panic lesthis feeble head might give way altogether under such excitement, and shebe left in the hands of a madman. Luckily this wild fit did not lastlong, and Patty gradually brought the savage, which was latent in hisundeveloped nature, into control. But she had got a fright, and wasstill a little afraid of him when the week was over, and her plans werelaid for the triumphant return home. She had written to her aunt on theday of her marriage, proclaiming the proud fact, and signing her letter,not with her Christian name, but that of Mrs. Gervase Piercey, in herpride and triumph. Mrs. Gervase Piercey! That she was now, let themrave as they pleased! Nobody could undo what Aunt Patience’s fiftypounds had done. Those whom God had joined together--or was it notrather Miss Hewitt, of Rose Cottage, and ambition and revenge? Patty,however, had no intentions appropriate to such motives in her mind. Shewas not revolted by the passion of Gervase, as another woman might havebeen. She felt it to be a compliment more or less; his noise anduproariousness, so that he could scarcely walk along a street withoutshoutings and loud laughter, did not in the least trouble her. Shesubdued him by degrees, bidding him look how people stared, andfrightening him with the suggestion that the world in general mightthink him off his head, and carry him off from her, if he did not learnto suppress these vociferous evidences of his happiness: a suggestionwhich had a great effect upon Gervase, and made him follow her aboutmeekly afterwards to all the sights which she thought it necessary inthis wonderful holiday to see. She took him to the Zoological Gardens,which he enjoyed immensely, dragging her about from one cage to another,not letting her off a single particular. They saw the lions fed, theygave buns to the bears, they rode like a couple of children upon thecamels and the elephant. Gervase drank deep of every pleasure which theresources of that Garden of Eden permitted. He had not been there sincehe was a child, and everything was delightful to him. The success wasnot so great when Patty took him to St Paul’s and the Tower, which sheconsidered to be fashionable resorts, where a bride and her finery oughtto be seen, and where Gervase walked about gaping, asking like a childat church when he could get out? Nor at the theatre, where Patty,instructed by the novels she had read, secured a box, and appeared infull costume, with that intoxicating proof that she was now a fine ladyand member of the aristocracy, a low dress--and with an opera-glasswherewith to scan the faces and dresses of the other distinguishedoccupants of boxes. She was herself surprised at various things whichshe had not learnt from books--the unimpressive character of the ladies’dresses, and the manner in which they gazed down into what she believedto be the pit, a part of the house which she regarded with scorn. It wasnot a fashionable house, for to Patty, naturally, a theatre was atheatre, wherever situated; but it was disappointing not to see theflashing of diamonds which she had expected, nor to have otheropera-glasses fixed upon herself as a new appearance in the world offashion, which was what she looked for. And Gervase was very troublesomein the theatre. He kept asking her what those people were doing on thestage, what all that talking was about, and when it would be time to goaway. When the merchant of ices and other light refections came round,Gervase was delighted, and even Patty felt that an ice in her box at thetheatre was great grandeur; but she was discouraged when she saw that itwas not a common indulgence, and that Gervase, peeling and eatingoranges, and flinging them about, attracted an attention which was notthat sentiment of mingled admiration and envy which Patty hoped toexcite. A few experiences of this kind opened her sharp eyes to manythings, and reduced the rapture with which she had looked forward to herentry into town as Mrs. Gervase Piercey. But these disenchantments, andscraps of talk which her sharp ears picked up and her still sharperimagination assimilated, suggested to her another kind of operation nexttime, and left her full of anticipations and the conviction that it onlywanted a little preparation, a little guidance, to ensure her perfecttriumph.This strange pair had what seemed to Patty boundless funds for theirweek in town. Twenty pounds over of Aunt Patience’s gift after payingthe expenses of the marriage, had seemed enough for the wildest desires;but when there was added to that twenty pounds more, his mother’s lastgift to Gervase, she felt that their wealth was fabulous; far, far toomuch to expend upon personal pleasure or sightseeing. She permittedherself to buy a dress or two, choosing those which were ready made, andof which she could see the effect at once, both on herself and theelegant young lady who sold them to her; and she put aside a ten-poundnote carefully, in case of any emergency. On the whole, however, it wasa relief to both parties when they went home, though it took sometrouble to convince Gervase that he could not go back to the Manor,leaving his wife at the Seven Thorns. He was not pleased to be told thathe too must go and live at the Seven Thorns: “Why, that’s what mothersaid--and draw the beer!” he cried; “but nothing shall make me draw thebeer,” cried Gervase. “Nobody asked you,” Patty said, “you goose. We’regoing to live in the west rooms, a beautiful set of rooms that I put allready, where there’s a nice sofa for you to lie on, and nice windows tolook out of and see everything that comes along the road--not likeGreyshott, where you never see nothing--the carts and the carriages andthe vans going to the fairs, and Punch and Judy, and I can’t tell youall what.” “Well,” said Gervase, “you can stay there, and I’ll come tosee you every day; but I must go home.” “What, leave me! and us but aweek married!” cried Patty. She made him falter in his resolution,confused with the idea of an arrangement of affairs unfamiliar to him,and at last induced him to consent to go to the Seven Thorns with her onconditions, strenuously insisted upon, that he was not to be made todraw beer. But Gervase did not feel easy on this subject, even when hewas taken by the new side-door into the separate suite of apartmentswhich Patty had prepared with so much trouble. When old Hewitt appearedhe took care to entrench himself behind his wife.“I’ll have nothing to do with the beer or the customers, mind you,” hecried nervously. Nobody, however, made any account of Gervase in thatwonderful moment of Patty’s return.“What! it’s you as is the new married couple? and you’ve gone andmarried _’im_?” cried Hewitt, with a tone of indescribable contempt.“Yes, father! and I’ll thank you to keep a civil tongue in your head;I’ve married him, and I mean to take care of him,” Patty cried, tossingher head.Old Hewitt laughed a low, long laugh. His mental processes were slow,and the sight of the Softy with his daughter had startled him much; fornotwithstanding all that had been said on this subject he had notbelieved in it seriously. Now, however, that it dawned upon him what hadreally happened, that his child, his daughter, was actually Mrs. GervasePiercey, a slow sensation of pride and victory arose in his bosom too.His girl to be Lady Piercey in her time, and drive in a grand carriage,and live in a grand house! The Hewitts were a fine old family, but theyhad never kept their carriage and pair. A one-horse shay had been theutmost length to which they had gone. Now Patty--Patty, the child! whohad always done his accounts and kept his customers in order--Patty, hisown girl, was destined to the glory of riding behind two horses andbeing called “my lady.” The thought made him burst into a long, rumblingsubterraneous laugh. Our Patty! it did not seem possible that it couldbe true.“That reminds me,” he said a moment after, turning suddenly grave. Hecalled his daughter apart, beckoning with his finger.Gervase by this time was lolling half out of the open window,delightedly counting the vehicles in sight. “Farmer Golightly’s taxcart, and Jim Mason’s big waggon, and the parson’s pony chaise, and afly up from the station,” he cried: “it’s livelier than London. Patty,Patty, come and look here.” Gervase turned round, and saw his wife andher father with grave faces consulting together, and relapsed intoabsolute quiet, effacing himself behind the fluttering curtains with theintention of stealing out of the room as soon as he could and gettingaway. His mother’s threat about drawing the beer haunted him. Could notshe, who could do most things, make that threat come true?“Patty,” said old Hewitt, “you’ve done it, and you can’t undo it; butthere’ll be ever such a rumpus up _there_.”“Of course, I know that,” she said calmly; “I’m ready for them. Let themtry all they can, there’s nothing they can do.”“Patty,” said the old innkeeper again, “I’ve something to tell you asyou ain’t a-thinking of. About ’Er,” he said, pointing with his thumbover his shoulder.“What about her? I know she’s my enemy; but you needn’t be frightened,father. I’ve seen to everything, and there’s nothing she can do.”“It ain’t that as I want you to think of. It’s more dreadful than that.It’s ‘in the midst of life as we are in death,’” said Hewitt. “That sortof thing; and they’ve been a-’unting for _’im_ far and wide.”“Lord, father, what do you mean?” Patty caught at a confused idea of SirGiles’ death, and her heart began to thump against her breast.Hewitt pointed with his thumb, jerking it again and again over hisshoulder. “She’s--she’s--dead,” he said.“Dead!” said Patty, with a shriek, “who’s dead?”Hewitt, less aware than she of Gervase’s wandering and unimpressionablemind, shook his head at her, jerking his thumb this time in front of himat the young man lolling out of the window. “Usht, can’t ye? Why, ’Er,’is mother,” he said, under his breath.A quick reflection passed through Patty’s mind. “Then, I’m her,” shesaid to herself, but then remembered that this was not the case that SirGiles’ death alone could make her Lady Piercey. As this flashed upon herthoughts, a bitter regret came into Patty’s mind--regret, keen as if shehad loved her, that Lady Piercey was dead, that she should have beenallowed to die. Oh, if she had but known! How quickly would she havebrought Gervase back to see his mother! Her triumph, whenever it shouldcome, would be shorn of one of its most poignant pleasures. Lady Pierceywould not be there to see it! She could never now be made to come downfrom her place, made to give up all her privileges to the girl whom shedespised. Patty felt so genuine a pang of disappointment that it broughtthe tears to her eyes. “I must tell him,” she said quickly,--the tearswere not without their use, too, and it is not always easy to call themup at will.“I wouldn’t to-night. Let ’im have ’is first night in peace,” said theinnkeeper, “and take ’is beer, and get the good of it like any otherman.”“Go down, perhaps you think, to your men in the parlour, and smoke withthem, and drink with them, and give you the chance to say as he’s yourson-in-law? and his mother lying dead all the time. No, father, not if Iknow it,” cried Patty, and she gave her head a very decided nod. “I knowwhat I’m about,” she added; “I know exactly what he’s going to do. So,father, you may go, and you can tell ’Liza that we’ll now have tea.”“I tell ’Liza! I’ll do none of your dirty errands,” said old Hewitt; buthis indignation answered Patty’s purpose, who was glad to get rid ofhim, in order that her own duty might be performed. She went forward tothe window where Gervase was sitting, and linked her arm in his, notwithout some resistance on the part of the Softy, who was whollyoccupied with his new pleasure.“Let alone, I tell you, Pat! One white horse on the off side, thatcounts five for me; and a whole team of black ’uns for the other fellow.Where’s all those black horses come from, I should like to know?”“Gervase dear, don’t you do it; don’t make a game with the black horses.It’s dreadful unlucky. They’re for a funeral, come from town on purpose.And oh! Gervase dear, do listen to me! for whose funeral do yousuppose?”“Is it a riddle?” said Gervase, showing his teeth from ear to ear.“Oh hush, hush, there’s a good boy! It’s not like you to make a joke ofsuch dreadful things.”“Why can’t you say then what it is, and have done with it?” Gervasesaid.“That’s just one of the sensible things you say when you please.Gervase--you remember your mother?”“I remember my mother? I should think I remembered my mother. You knowit’s only a week to-day--or was it yesterday?”“It was yesterday. You might remember the day you were married, I think,without asking me,” said Patty, with spirit. “Well, then, you partedfrom her that day. She wasn’t ill then, was she, dear?”Upon which Gervase laughed. “Mother’s always ill,” he said. “She hassuch health you never know when she’s well, or, at least, so she says.It’s in her head, or her liver, or her big toe. No!” he cried, withanother great laugh, “it’s father as has the devil in his big toe.”“Gervase, do be serious for a moment. Your mother has been very ill,dreadful bad, and we never knew----”“I told you,” he said calmly, “she’s always bad; and you can never tellfrom one day to another, trust herself, when she mayn’t die.”“Oh, Gervase,” cried Patty, holding his arm with both her hands: “youare fond of her a little bit, ain’t you, dear? She’s your mother, thoughshe hasn’t been very nice to me.”“Lord,” cried Gervase, “how she will jump when she knows that I’m here,and on my own hook, and have got a wife of my own! Mind, it is you thathave got to tell her, and not me.”“A wife that will always try to be a comfort to you,” said Patty. “Oh,my poor dear boy! Gervase, your poor mother (remember that I’m here totake care of you whatever happens),--Gervase, your mother will neverneed to be told. She’s dead and gone, poor lady, she’s dead and gone!”Gervase stared at her, and again opened his mouth in a great laugh.“That’s one of your dashed stories,” he said.“It isn’t a story at all, it’s quite true. She had a stroke that veryday. Fancy, just the very day when we---- And we never heard a word. Ifwe had heard I should have been the very first to bring you home.”“What good would that have done?” Gervase said sullenly, “we were betterwhere we were.”“Not and her dying, and wanting her son.”Gervase was cowed and troubled by the news, which gave him a shock whichhe could not understand. It made him sullen and difficult to manage.“You’re playing off one of your jokes upon me,” he said.“I playing a joke! I’d have found something better than a funeral tojoke about. Gervase, we have just come back in time. The funeral’sto-morrow, and oh! I’m so thankful we came home. I’m going to send forSally Fletcher to make me up some nice deep mourning with crape, like alady wears for her own mother.”“She was no mother of yours,” said Gervase, with a frown.“No; nor she didn’t behave like one: but being her son’s wife and onethat is to succeed her, I must get my mourning deep; and you and me,we’ll go. We’ll walk next to Sir Giles, as chief mourners,” she said.Gervase gave a lowering look at her, and then he turned away to the openwindow, to count as he had been doing before, but in changing tones, thewhite horses and the brown.CHAPTER XXII.Patty sat up half the night with Sally Fletcher, arranging as rapidlyand efficiently as possible her new _mise en scène_. To work all nightat mourning was by no means a novel performance for Miss Fletcher, thelame girl who was the village dressmaker; and she felt herself amplyrepaid by the news, as yet almost unknown to the neighbours, of theSofty’s marriage and Patty’s new pretentions. It is true that it had alittle leaked out in the evening symposium in Hewitt’s parlour; but whatthe men said when they came home from their dull, long booze was notreceived with that faith which ladies put in the utterances of theclubs. The wives of the village had always a conviction that the men had“heard wrong”--that it would turn out something quite different from thestory told in the watches of the night, or dully recalled next day,confused by the fumes of last night’s beer. But Sally Fletcher knew thather tale would meet with full credence, and that her cottage nextmorning would be crowded with inquirers; so that her night’s work wasnot the matter of hardship it might have been supposed. She wascomforted with cups of tea during the course of the night, and Pattyspent at least half of it with her, helping on the work in a resplendentblue dressing-gown, which she had bought in London, trimmed with laceand ribbons, and dazzling to Sally’s eyes. The dressmaker had broughtwith her the entire stock of crape which was to be had in “the shop,” amaterial kept for emergencies, and not, it may be supposed, of the veryfreshest or finest--which Patty laid on with a liberal hand, coveringwith it the old black dress, which she decided would do in the urgencyof the moment. It was still more difficult to plaster that panoply ofmourning over the smart new cape, also purchased in town: but this, too,was finished, and a large hatband, as deep as his hat, procured forGervase, before the air began to thrill with the tolling, lugubrious andlong drawn out, of the village bells, which announced that theprocession was within sight.It was a great funeral. All the important people of that side of thecounty--or their carriages--were there. An hour before the _cortège_arrived, Sir Giles’ chair, an object of curiosity to all the villageboys, was brought down to the gate of the churchyard, that he mightfollow his wife to the grave’s side. And a great excitement had arisenin the village itself. Under any circumstances, Lady Piercey’s funeral,the carriages and the flowers, and the mutes and the black horses, wouldhave produced an impression; but that impression was increased now bythe excitement of a very different kind which mingled with it. PattyHewitt, of the Seven Thorns, now Mrs. Gervase Piercey, would be there;and there was not a house, from the Rectory downwards, in which thequestion was not discussed--what would happen? Would Patty receive thetacit recognition of being allowed to take her place along with herhusband. Her husband! could he be anybody’s husband, the Softy? Wouldthe marriage stand? Would Sir Giles allow it? The fact that it was SirGiles gave the eager spectators their only doubt--or hope. Had it beenLady Piercey, she would never have allowed it. She would have thrownback the pretender from the very church-door. She would have rejectedPatty, thrust her out of the way, seized her son, and dragged him fromthe girl who had entrapped him. At the very church-door! Everybody, fromthe rector down to the sexton’s wife, felt perfectly convinced of that.But it would not be Lady Piercey she would have to deal with. LadyPiercey, though she filled so great a position in the ceremonial, wouldhave nothing to say on the subject; and it was part of the irony offate, felt by everybody, though none were sufficiently instructed tocall it by that name, that she should be there, incapable of taking anyshare in what would have moved her so deeply--triumphed over in hercoffin by the adversary with whom, living, she would have made suchshort work. There was something tragic about this situation which madethe bystanders hold their breath. And no one knew what Patty was aboutto do. That she would claim her share in the celebration, and, somehow,manage to take a part in it, no one doubted; but how she was toaccomplish this was the exciting uncertainty that filled all minds. Ittroubled the rector as he put on his surplice to meet the silentnew-comer, approaching with even more pomp than was her wont thefamiliar doors of her parish church. There was not much more sentimentthan is inseparable from that last solemnity in the minds of herneighbours towards Lady Piercey. She had not been without kindness of apractical kind. Doles had been made and presents given in theconventional way without any failure; but nobody had loved the grim oldlady. There was nothing, therefore, to take off the interest in theother more exciting crisis.    “Rattle her bones     Over the stones,     She’s only a pauper, whom nobody owns.”Far from a pauper was the Lady Piercey of Greyshott; but the effect wasthe same. There are many equalising circumstances in death.It was imposing to witness the black procession coming slowly along thesunshiny road. Old Miss Hewitt from Rose Cottage came out to view it,taking up a conspicuous position on the churchyard wall. So far fromwearing decorous black in reverence of the funeral, Miss Hewitt wasdressed in all that was most remarkable in her wardrobe in the way ofcolour. She wore a green dress; she had a large Paisley shawl of manycolours--an article with which the present generation is virtuallyunacquainted--on her shoulders, and her bonnet was trimmed with goldlace and flowers. She had a conviction that Sir Giles would see her, andthat he would perceive the difference between her still handsome face,and unbroken height and carriage, and the old ugly wife whom he wasburying--poor old Sir Giles, entirely broken down by weakness and thebreach of all his habits and ways, as well as by the feeling, not veryelevated perhaps, but grievous enough, of loss, in one who had managedeverything for him, and taken all trouble from his shoulders! Theremight be some emotion deeper still in the poor old gentleman’s mind; butthese at least were there, enough to make his dull eyes, always moistwith slow-coming tears, quite incapable of the vision or contrast inwhich that fierce old woman hoped.The interest of the moment concentrated round the lych-gate, where agreat deal was to take place. Already conspicuous among the crowdassembled there to meet the funeral were two figures, the chief of whomwas veiled from head to foot in crape, and leant upon the arm of herhusband heavily, as if overcome with grief. Patty had a deep crape veil,behind which was visible a white handkerchief often pressed to her eyes,and in the other hand, a large wreath. Gervase stood beside her, inblack clothes to be sure, and with a deep hatband covering his hat, butwith no such monumental aspect of woe. His light and wandering eyesstrayed over the scene, arresting themselves upon nothing, not even onthe approaching procession. Sometimes Patty almost bent him down on theside on which she leant, by a new access of grief. Her shoulders heaved,her sobs were audible, when the head of the doleful procession arrived.She moved her husband forward to lay the wreath upon the coffin and thenlifting her great veil for a moment looked on with an air of agonisinganxiety, while Sir Giles was lifted out of the carriage and placed inhis chair, with little starts of anxious feeling as if he were beingtouched roughly by the attendants, and she could scarcely restrainherself from taking him out of their hands. It was a pity that poor oldSir Giles, entirely absorbed in his own sensations, did not observe thisat all, any more than he observed the airs of Miss Hewitt equallyintended for his notice. But when Sir Giles had been placed in hischair, Patty recovering her energy in a moment, dragged her husbandforward and dexterously slid and pushed him immediately behind hisfather’s chair, coming sharply in contact as she did so with ColonelPiercey, who was about to take that place. “I beg your pardon, we arethe chief mourners,” she said sharply, and with decision. And then Pattyrelapsed all at once into her grief. She walked slowly forwardhalf-leading, half-pushing Gervase, her shoulders heaving with sobs, amurmur of half-audible affliction coming in as a sort of half-refrain tothe words read by the clergyman. The village crowding round, watchedwith bated breath. It was difficult for these spectators to refuse amurmur of applause. How beautifully she did it? What a mourner she made,far better than any one else there! As for that Mrs. Osborne, her veilwas only gauze, and through it you could see that she was not crying atall! She walked by Colonel Piercey’s side, but she did not lean upon himas if she required support. There was no heaving in her shoulders. Themind of the village approved the demeanour of Patty with enthusiasm. Itwas something like! Even Miss Hewitt, flaunting her red and yellowbonnet on the churchyard wall, was impressed by the appearance of Patty,and acknowledged that it was deeply appropriate, and just exactly whatshe ought to have done.But though Patty was thus overcome with grief, her vigilant eyes notedeverything through the white handkerchief and the crape. When poor SirGiles broke down and began to sob at the grave it was she who, with anenergetic push and pressure, placed Gervase by his side.“Speak to him,” she whispered in his ear, with a voice which though solow was imperative as any order. She leaned herself over the other sideof the chair, almost pushing Dunning out of the way, while stillmaintaining her pressure on Gervase’s arm.“Father,” he said, putting his hand upon the old man’s; he was not tosay too much, she had instructed him! Only his name, or a kind word.Gervase, poor fellow, did not know how to say a kind word, but his dullimagination had been stirred and the contagion of his father’s feebledistress moved him. He began to sob, too, leaning heavily upon SirGiles’ chair. Not that he knew very well what was the cause. The greatshining oaken chest that was being lowered down into that hole had noassociation for him. He had not seen his mother placed there. But thegloomy ceremonial affected Gervase in spite of himself. Happily it didnot move him to laugh, which was on the cards, as Patty felt. It madehim cry, which was everything that could be desired.And Sir Giles did not push away his son’s hand, which was what mighthave happened also. The old gentleman was in precisely the state of mindto feel that touch and the sound of the wavering voice. It was a returnof the prodigal when the poor old father’s heart was very forlorn, andthe sensation of having some one still who belonged to him most welcome.To be sure there was Colonel Piercey--but he would go away, and was notin any sense a son of the house. And Meg--but she was a dependant,perhaps pleased to think she would have nobody over her now. Gervase washis father’s own, come back; equally feeble, not shaming his father byundue self-control. To hear his boy sob was sweet to the old man; it didhim more good than Dunning’s whispered adjurations not to fret, to“think of your own ’ealth,” to “’old up, Sir Giles!” When he felt thehand of Gervase and heard his helpless son sob, a flash of force came tothe old man.“It’s you and me now, Gervase, only you and me, my boy,” he said loudout, interrupting the voice of the rector. It was a dreadful thing todo, and yet it had a great effect, the voice of nature breaking in, intothe midst of all that ceremony and solemnity. Old Sir Giles’ bare, bowedhead, and the exclamation loud, broken with a sob, which everybody couldhear, moved many people to tears. Even the rector paused a moment beforehe pronounced the final benediction, and the mourners began to disperseand turn away.One other moment of intense anxiety followed for Patty. She had to keepher Softy up to the mark. All had gone well so far, but to keep him inthe same humour for a long time together was well nigh an impossibleachievement. When Sir Giles’ chair was turned round, Patty almost pushedit herself in her anxiety to keep close, and it was no small exertion tokeep Gervase steadily behind, yet not to hustle Dunning, who lookedround at her fiercely. If there should happen to come into the Softy’smind the idea of rushing off with his father, which was his usual ideawhen he stood behind Sir Giles’ chair! But some benevolent influencewatched over Patty on that critical day. Gervase, occupied in watchingthe equipages, of which no man had ever seen so many at Greyshott,walked on quietly to the carriage door. He got in after Sir Giles as ifthat were quite natural, forgetting the “manners” she had tried to teachhim; but Patty minded nothing at that moment of fate. She scrambled inafter him, her heart beating wildly, and no one venturing to oppose.Dunning, indeed, who followed, looked unutterable things. He said: “SirGiles, is it your meaning as this--this lady----?”But Sir Giles said never a word. He kept patting his son’s hand, saying,“Only you and me, my boy.” He took no notice of the intruder into thecarriage, and who else dared to speak? As for Patty’s sentiments, theywere altogether indescribable. They were complicated by personalsensations which were not agreeable. The carriage went slowly, thewindows were closed on account of Sir Giles, though the day was warm.And she was placed on the front seat, beside Dunning, which was aposition which gave her nausea, and made her head swim, as well as beinghighly inappropriate to her dignified position. But anything was to beborne in the circumstances, for the glory of being seen to drive “home”in the carriage with Sir Giles, and the chance of thus getting asurreptitious but undeniable entrance into the house. She said nothing,partly from policy, partly from discomfort, during that prolonged andtedious drive. And Gervase behaved himself with incredible discretion.Gervase, too, was glad to be going “home.” He was pleased after all thathad passed to be sitting by his father again. And he did Sir Giles goodeven by his foolishness, the poor Softy. After keeping quite quiet forhalf of the way, suffering his father to pat his hand, and repeat thatlittle formula of words, saying “Don’t cry, father, don’t cry,” softly,from time to time, he suddenly burst forth: “I say! look at thosefellows riding over the copses. You don’t let them ride over our copses,do you, father?”“Never mind, never mind, my boy,” said Sir Giles. But he was roused tolook up, and his sobbing ceased.“I wish you’d stop the carriage and let me get at them. They shouldn’tride that way again, I promise you,” Gervase cried.“You can’t interfere to-day, Mr. Gervase,” Dunning presumed to say. “Notthe day of my lady’s funeral, Sir Giles. You can’t have the carriagestopped to-day.”“Mind your own business, Dunning,” said Sir Giles, sharply. “No, my boy,never mind, never mind. We must just put up with it for a day. It don’tmatter, it don’t matter, Gervase, what happens now----”“But that isn’t my opinion at all,” said Gervase; “it matters a deal,and they shall see it does. Job Woodley, isn’t it, and young George?They think it won’t be noticed, but I’ll notice it. I’ll take care theysha’n’t put upon you, father, now that you have nobody but me.”“God bless you, Gervase, you only want to be roused; that’s what yourpoor dear mother used always to say.”“And now you’ll find him thoroughly roused, Sir Giles, and you candepend upon him that he will always look after your interests,” Pattysaid.The old gentleman looked at her with bewildered eyes, gazing heavilyacross the carriage, only half aware of what she was saying, or who shewas. And then they all drove on to Greyshott in solemn silence. They hadcome up by this time to the great gates, and entered the avenue. Patty’sheart beat more and more with suspense and excitement. Everything nowseemed to hang upon what took place in the next hour.CHAPTER XXIII.Gervase went up the steps and into his father’s house without waitingeither for Sir Giles, whose disembarkation was a troublesome business,or his newly-made wife. For the moment he had forgotten all about Patty.She had to scramble out of the high old-fashioned chariot, which hadbeen Sir Giles’ state equipage for long, and which had been got outexpressly for this high and solemn ceremony, nobody taking any notice orextending a finger to her--even the footman turning his back. Patty wastoo anxious and too determined on making her own entry to be muchdisturbed by this. To get her feet within the house was the great thingshe had to consider; _but_--it need not be said that John Simpson, thefootman, had his fate decided from that day, if indeed Mrs. Gervaseestablished, as she intended to do, her footing in her husband’s home.Gervase stood on the threshold, carelessly overlooking the group, themen about Sir Giles’ chair putting him back into it, and Patty not verygracefully getting down the steps of the carriage. His tall hat, woundwith the heavy band, was placed on the back of his head, his hands werein his pockets, his eyes wandering, catching one detail after another,understanding no special significance in the scene. The other carriagescoming up behind, waiting till the first should move on, aroused theSofty. He had forgotten why they were there, as he had forgotten that hehad any duty towards his wife, who, in her hurry, had twisted herself inher long veil and draperies, and whom no one attempted to help. Pattywas not the kind of figure to attract sentimental sympathy, as does theneglected dependant of fiction, the young wife of low degree in presenceof a proud and haughty family. She was briskness and energy itself,notwithstanding that complication with the long veil, at which Gervasewas just about to burst into a loud laugh when a sudden glance from hereyes paralysed him with his mouth open. As it took a long time toarrange Sir Giles, Patty had the situation before her and time to graspit. She saw her opportunity at once. She passed the group of men aboutthe chair, touching Dunning’s arm sharply as she passed, bidding him to“take care, take care!” Then, stepping on, took the arm of Gervase, andstood with him on the threshold, like (she fondly hoped) the lady of thehouse receiving her guests. Dunning had nearly dropped his master’schair altogether at that insolent injunction and touch, and looked up ather with a countenance crimson with rage and enmity. But when Dunningsaw the energetic figure in the doorway, holding Gervase’s limp arm, andunconsciously pushing him to one side in so doing, placing herself inthe centre, standing there like the mistress of the house, a cold shiverran over him. “You could ’a knocked me down with a straw,” he saidafterwards confidentially to Parsons, in the mutual review they madelater of all the exciting incidents of the day.But this was not all: the opportunity comes to those who are capable ofseizing upon it. Patty stood there with a heart beating so loudly thatit sounded like a drum in her own ears, but with so full a sense of theimportance of every act and look, that her excited nerves, instead ofmastering her, gave support and stimulation to her whole being. Shemight have known, she said to herself, that Gervase would have been ofno use to her, a thing which she resented, being now in possession ofhim, though she had fully calculated upon it before. “Stand by yourwife, can’t you!” she whispered fiercely, as she took hold of his armand thrust him towards the wall. He grinned at her, though he dared notlaugh aloud.“Lord, you did look ridiculous, Patty, with that long thing twistinground you.”“If you laugh, you fool,” said Patty, between her closed teeth, “you’llbe turned out of the house.”When she had warned him she turned, bland but anxious, to the groupbelow. “Oh, carry him gently, carry him gently!” she cried. When SirGiles was set down on the level of the hall, she was the first toperceive his exhausted state. “I hope you have a cordial or something togive him, after all this fatigue?” she said. “You have nothing with you?Let the butler get it instantly--instantly!” She was quite right, andDunning knew it, and made a sign that this unexpected order should beobeyed, with bitter anger in his heart. The old gentleman was verynearly fainting, after all the exertion and emotion. Patty had salts inher hand and eau de Cologne in her pocket ready for any emergency. Sheflew to him, while Dunning in his rage and pain called to the butler tomake haste. And when the rest of the party followed, Patty was found incharge of Sir Giles, leaning over him, fanning him with her handkerchiefimpregnated with eau de Cologne, applying from time to time her salts tohis nose. When the butler came hurrying back with the medicine, thefirst thing the surrounding spectators were conscious of was her voicesharply addressing Dunning, “You ought to have had the drops ready; youought to have carried them with you; you ought never to be withoutsomething to give in case of faintness--and after such a dreadful day.”The woman, the creature, the alehouse girl (these were the names bywhich Dunning overwhelmed her in his private discourses), was quiteright! He ought to have carried his master’s drops with him. He ought tohave been ready for the emergency. Margaret, who had come in in themidst of this scene, after one glimpse of Mrs. Gervase standing in thedoorway, which had filled her with consternation, stood by helplesslyfor the moment, not doing anything. Mrs. Osborne would not have venturedto interfere with Dunning at any period of her residence at Greyshott.His authority with the family had been supreme. They had grown to thinkthat Sir Giles’ life depended upon him; that he knew better than thevery doctor. To see Dunning thus assailed took away her breath, as itdid that of all the servants, standing helplessly gaping at their masterin his almost faint. And it was evident from Dunning’s silence, and hishurried proceedings, that this audacious intruder was right--astoundingdiscovery! Dunning did not say a word for himself. His hand trembled so,that Patty seized the bottle from him, and dropped the liquid herselfwith a steady hand. “Now, drink this,” she said authoritatively,putting it to Sir Giles’ lips, who obeyed her, though in hishalf-unconsciousness he had been feebly pushing Dunning away. Thisastonishing scene kept back all the other funeral guests who werealighting at the door, and among whom the most dreadful anticipationswere beginning to breathe to the effect that it had been “too much” forSir Giles. To see Margaret Osborne standing there helpless, doingnothing, gave force to their suppositions, for she must have beenoccupied with her uncle had there been anything to do for him, everybodythought. Patty’s shorter figure, all black, was not distinguishable frombelow as she leant over Sir Giles’ chair.Gervase, who had been hanging in the doorway, reduced to completesilence by his wife’s threats, pulled Margaret by her dress. “I say,Meg! she’s one, ain’t she? She’s got ’em all down, even Dunning. Lord!just look at her going it!” the admiring husband said. He dared notlaugh, but his wide-open mouth grinned from ear to ear. He did not knowwho the tall fellow was by Margaret’s side, who stood looking on withsuch a solemn air, but he poked that dignitary with his elbow all thesame. “Ain’t she as good as a play?” Gervase said.Colonel Piercey was in no very genial frame of mind. He was angry to seeMrs. Osborne superseded, and angry with her that she did not stepforward and take the direction of everything. And when this fool, thisSofty, as the country people called him, addressed himself with elbowand voice, his disgust was almost beyond bounds. It was not decorous ofthe next-of-kin: he turned away from the grinning idiot with a sharpexclamation, forgetting altogether that he was, more or less, the masterof the house.“Oh, hush, Gervase,” said Mrs. Osborne. “Don’t laugh: you will shock allthe people. She is---- very serviceable. She shows---- great sense----Gervase, why is she here?”He was on the point of laughter again, but was frightened this time byMargaret. “Why, here’s just where she ought to be,” he said, with asuppressed chuckle. “I told you, but you didn’t understand. I almosttold---- mother.”Here the half-witted young man paused a little with a sudden air oftrouble. “Mother; what’s all this about mother?” he said.“Oh, Gervase! she wanted you so!”“Well,” he cried, “but how could I come when I didn’t know? Ask her. Wenever heard a word. I remember now. We only came back last night. Ithought after all we might find her all right when we came back. Isit--is it true, Meg?”He spoke with a sort of timidity behind Patty’s back, still pulling hiscousin’s dress, the grin disappearing from his face, but his hat stillon the back of his head, and his fatuous eyes wandering. His attentionwas only half arrested even by a question of such importance. It movedthe surface of his consciousness, and no more; his eye, even while hewas speaking, was caught by the unruly action of the horses in one ofthe carriages far down the avenue, which put a movement of interest intohis dull face.“I cannot speak to you about it all here. Come in, and I will tell youeverything,” Margaret said.He made a step after her, and then looked back; but Patty was stillbusily engaged with Sir Giles, and her husband escaped, putting hiscousin’s tall figure between himself and her.“I say, are all this lot of people coming here? What are they cominghere for? Have I got to talk to all these people, Meg?”He went after her into the library, where already some of the guestswere, and where Margaret was immediately occupied, receiving the solemnleave-takings of the county gentry, who had driven so far for thisceremony, but who looked strangely at Gervase, still with his hat on,and who, in presence of such a chief mourner, and of the illness of poorSir Giles, were eager to get away. A vague story about the marriage hadalready flashed through the neighbourhood, but the gentlemen were moredesirous even of keeping clear of any embarrassment that might arisefrom it, than of getting “the rights of the story” to carry back totheir wives--though that also was a strong motive. Gervase gave a largegrip of welcome to several who spoke to him, and laughed, and said itwas a fine day, with an apparent indifference to the object of theirvisit, which chilled the blood of the kindly neighbours. And still morepotent than any foolishness he might utter was the sign of the hat onhis head, which produced the profoundest impression upon the smallsolemn assembly, though even Margaret, in the excitement of the crisisaltogether, did not notice it for some time.“We feel that the only kindness we can do you, dear Mrs. Osborne, is toleave you alone as quickly as possible,” said Lord Hartmore, who was avery dignified person, and generally took the lead--and he was followedby the other potentates, who withdrew almost hurriedly, avoiding Gervaseas much as possible, as he stood swaying from one foot to another, witha half laugh of mingled vacuity and embarrassment. Gervase was ratherdisappointed that they should all go away. It was rarely that he hadseen so many people gathered together under his father’s roof. He triedto detain one or two of them who gave him a second grasp of the hand asthey passed him.“You’re going very soon. Won’t you stay and have something?” Gervasesaid.Colonel Piercey was standing outside the door of the library as theybegan to come out, and Lord Hartmore gave him a very significant look,and a still more significant grasp of the hand.“That,” he said with emphasis, with a backward movement of his head toindicate the room he had just quitted, “is the saddest sight ofall,”--and there was a little pause of the gentlemen about the door, agroup closed up the entrance to the room, all full of something to say,which none of them ventured to put into words; all relieving themselveswith shaking of heads and meaning looks.“Poor Sir Giles! I have the sincerest sympathy with him,” said LordHartmore, “the partner of his life gone, and so little comfort in thepoor son.”They grasped Gerald Piercey’s hand, one by one, in a sort of chorus,grouping round the open door.It was at this moment that Patty found herself free, Sir Giles havingbeen wheeled away to his own rooms to escape the agitating encounter ofso many strangers. She walked towards them with the heroic confidence ofa Joan of Arc. Probably nothing but the habits of her previous life, hercustom of facing unruly men in various stages of difficulty,dissatisfied customers, and those of too convivial a turn, drunkards,whom she had to master by sheer coolness and strength of mind, couldhave armed her for such an extraordinary emergency. She knew most of themen by sight, but had hitherto looked at them from a distance as beingsunapproachable, not likely ever to come within touch of herself or herlife; and they all looked towards her, more or less severely,--some withsurprise, some with concealed amusement, some with the sternestdisapproval. So many men of might and dignity, personages in the county,not one among them sympathetic; and one small young woman, in a placethe very external features of which were unknown to her, where everyindividual was an enemy, yet which she meant to take possession of andconquer by her bow and her spear, turning out every dissident! Thegentlemen stood and stared, rather in astonishment than in curiosity, asshe advanced alone, her long veil hanging behind her, her crape sweepingthe carpet. They did not make way for her, which was scarcely so muchfrom incivility as from surprise, but stood staring, blocking up thedoor of a room which Patty saw must be the first stronghold to be taken,from the mere fact of the group that stood before it. She came up quiteclose to them without saying a word, holding her head high. And then sheraised her high, rather sharp voice:--“Will you please to make room for me to pass? I want to join myhusband,” she said.And then there was a start as simultaneous as the stare had been.Patty’s voice gave the gentlemen of the county a shock as if a cannonhad been fired into the midst of them. It was a challenge and anaccusation in one. To accuse men of their class of a breach of civilityis worse than firing a gun among them. They separated quickly with asense of shame. “I beg your pardon” came from at least two voices. Itwould be difficult to explain what they thought they could have done toresist the intruder: but they were horrified by the suggestion ofinterference--as if they had anything to do with it! so that in factPatty entered triumphantly through a lane formed by two lines of mendividing to make way for her. A princess could not have done more.She walked in thus with flags flying, pale with the effort, which wasadvantageous to her appearance, and found herself in the great room,with its bookcases on the one hand and the tall portraits on the other.But Patty found here, against her expectations, a far more difficultscene before her. Two or three ladies had come to give Margaret Osbornethe support of their presence, on what they called “this trying day,”without in the least realising how trying it was to be. One of them, anold lady, sat in a great chair facing the door, with her eyes fixed uponit. Two others, younger, but scarcely less alarming, were talking toMrs. Osborne, who in her own sole person had been supposed by Patty withnatural enmity to be the chief of her adversaries. They stopped theirconversation and stared at Patty, as with a sudden faltering, she camein. Gervase stood against the end window, fully outlined against thelight, with his hands in his pockets, and his hat on his head, swayingfrom one foot to another, his lower lip hanging a little and very moist,his wandering eyes turned towards the door. Patty entering alone underthe eyes of these ladies, with a consciousness that much had passedsince she had last looked at herself in a glass, and that veil andmantle might easily have got awry--and with the additional excitement ofsurprise in finding them there when she had looked at the worst only forthe presence of Mrs. Osborne--might well have called forth a sympatheticmovement in any bosom. And when it is added to this that Gervase,standing there against the light, had probably never in all his lifelooked so idiotic before, and that _he had his hat on his head_, lastand most dreadful climax of all, it may be dimly imagined what were thesensations of his bride. But there are circumstances in which an unusualexaggeration of trouble brings support. Patty looked for a moment andthen rushed upon her husband in horror. “Oh, Gervase! do you know youhave got your hat on, and ladies in the room?” she cried, with an almostshriek of dismay.Gervase put up his hand to his head, took off the hat, and thencarefully examined it, as if to find the reason of offence there. “HaveI?” he said, with a laugh; “then I never knew it. You should stick by meif you mean me to behave. _I_ don’t think of such things.”“Then you ought,” she cried, breathless, taking the hat from him with awife’s familiarity, “and you ought to beg pardon.” She took him by thearm quickly and led him forward a step or two. “Ladies,” she said, “I amsure me and my husband are very glad to see you. He meant no rudeness,I’m sure. He doesn’t think about such little things. I am still,” sheadded, “a sort of a stranger”--with an insinuating smile which, however,was very tremulous, for Patty’s nerves were strained to the utmost. Shepaused a moment for breath. “A bride has the feeling that the friends ofthe family know her husband better than she does; and it’s such a sadoccasion to begin. But I’m sure I may say both for him and for me thatwe are pleased, and will always be pleased, to see old friends here.”The ladies sat and stared at her speechless. What reply could be made toa woman so manifestly within her rights?CHAPTER XXIV.Patty felt, which was surely very natural, that the worst of hertroubles were over after this scene; and when Mrs. Osborne went out withthe ladies, going with them from sheer inability to know what to do--shethrew herself into a great chair, which seemed to embrace and supporther, with a sense at once of having earned and fully deserved therepose, and also of having been successful all along the line. She hadencountered almost all who were likely to be her adversaries, and theyhad all given way before her. To be sure, there had not been much saidto her: the gentlemen had stood aside to let her in, the ladies hadstared and said nothing, only one of them had turned with a littlecompunction of civility to bow to her as she went away. The old lady,whom Patty knew to be Lady Hartmore, had waddled out, saying: “Well,Meg, we shall say all we have to say another time,” and had not so muchas looked again at Patty. Meg Osborne, as Patty had begun to call her,had kept her eyes on the ground, and had accompanied her friends to thedoor without a word. But still it was Patty who had driven them away,not they who had interfered with Patty. When one of the armies in anengagement encamps upon the field of battle, that belligerent isgenerally admitted to have won the day. And here was Mrs. Gervaseresting in that large deep chair, which was such an one as Patty Hewitthad never seen before, enjoying a moment of well-earned repose in herown house. Was it her own house? Her pulses were all throbbing with theexcitement of conflict and the pride of victory; but she was aware thather triumph was not yet assured. Nevertheless, everything was in herfavour. This grand house into which she had made her way, and which waseven grander than Patty had supposed, was certainly her husband’s home,and she was his wife as legally, as irrevocably as if she had beenmarried with the consent of all the parents in the world. Nothing couldpart her from her husband, neither force nor law, and though her heartstill owned a thrill of alarm and insecurity, she became more at ease asshe thought the matter over. Who dared turn her out of the house intowhich she had so bravely fought her way? Nobody but Sir Giles, who wasnot equal to the effort, who would not wish to do it, she felt sure.Patty had a conviction in her mind that she only required to be letalone and allowed access to him for a single day to get wholly the upperhand of Sir Giles. And who else had any right to interfere? Not MegOsborne, who had herself no right to be at Greyshott, except as a humblecompanion and hanger-on. A niece! what was a niece in the house? Pattyherself had a poor cousin who had been taken in at the Seven Thorns, asa sort of inferior servant, out of charity, as everybody said, and whoselife Patty well knew had been a very undesirable one. What was MegOsborne more than Mary Thorne? She had no right to say a word. Neitherhad the tall gentleman, of whom she was, however, more frightened, whomshe had already discovered to be Colonel Piercey, the nearest relation.How persons like Patty do make such discoveries is wonderful, a sciencewhich cannot be elucidated or formulated in mere words. She knew byinstinct, and she knew also that he could not interfere. The servantswere more in Patty’s way, and her hatred of them was sharp and keen--butshe had already managed to discredit Dunning, and she was not afraid ofthe servants. What could they do? What would they venture to do againstthe son’s wife? All these thoughts were passing through her mind as sherested in the great chair. And yet that repose was not without thorns.Gervase, though he stood still and stared while the ladies withdrew, didnot rest as she was doing. He walked to the window, to look out, andstood there fidgetting, and eager to take part in all the commotionoutside. “Lord!” he cried, “Hartmore’s carriage is sent round to thestables, and my lord has got to wait, and Stubbins, the little parson,is offering his fly. Oh, I can’t stay here, Patty, I must be in the fun.You can get on very well by yourself without me.”“What do you want with fun the day of your mother’s funeral?” she saidseverely. “They’ll all think a deal more of you if you stay quiet here.”Gervase’s countenance fell at the suggestion of his mother’s funeral. Nodoubt, had he been at home, had his dull mind acquainted itself with thepreliminaries, he would have been more or less moved. But it was toogreat an effort of mind for him to connect the ceremony in thechurchyard, the grave and the flowers, with Lady Piercey, whom he hadleft in her usual health, deciding everything in her usual peremptoryway. He had a strong impression that she would presently appear on thescene as usual and settle everything; and a sort of alarm came over hisface, and his spirit was overawed for a moment by the mention of hername. There succeeded accordingly, for about a minute, silence in theroom, which left Patty time to go over the question again. Who couldinterfere with her? Nobody! Not Meg Osborne, not Colonel Piercey, not amere housekeeper or butler. Oh dear no! Nobody but Sir Giles himself!Patty settled herself more and more comfortably in her chair. Thefuneral had been at an unusually late hour, and it was now almostevening. She thought that after a little interval she would ring thebell for tea. If any one had need of refreshment after the labour of theday, it was she. And after that there were many things to think of, bothsmall things and great things. What should she do about dinner, forinstance? Meg Osborne, no doubt, had got a full wardrobe of mourning,day dress and evening dress (at her, Patty’s, expense!), while Mrs.Gervase Piercey had only the gown which she had on, an old dressplastered with crape. Should she wear this for dinner? The thought ofgoing down to dinner, sitting down with a footman behind her chair, andall the etiquette involved, was almost too much for Patty, and took awayher breath. Should she brush the skirt, and smarten up the neck and wearthis? Or should she send down to the Seven Thorns for her black silk,and explain that she had not had time to get proper mourning? Gervasehad begun to fidget again while she carried on this severe course ofthought. She could hear him laughing to himself at the window, makingoccasional exclamations. “Oh, by Jove!” he called out at last. “There’slots more coming, one on the top of another. I’m going to see afterthem.” She was so deep in her meditations, that he was gone before shecould interfere. And thus she was left in the great silent library, aroom such as she had never seen before, overawing her with the sight ofthe bookcases, the white marble faces looking down upon her of the buststhat stood high up here and there, the full-length portraits that staredupon her from the other side. Many people, quite as little educated asPatty--or less so, for the sixth standard necessarily includes manythings--had come and gone lightly enough, and thought nothing of thebooks or the ancestors. I doubt much whether Margaret Osborne had halfso much general information as Patty had; but, then, their habits ofmind were very different. Mrs. Gervase, when she was left alone, couldnot help being a little overawed by all she saw. Her husband was notmuch to hold on by, but yet he “belonged there,” and she did not. Pattyhad felt increasingly, ever since the day on which she married him, howvery little her husband was to be depended upon. She had fullyrecognised that before the marriage, and had decided that she should notmind. But now it seemed a grievance to Patty that he could not defendher and advise her; that she had nobody but herself to look to; thatquite possibly he might even abandon her at the most critical moment.“There is never any calculating,” she said to herself bitterly, “what afool may do;” in which sentiment Patty echoed, without knowing it, allthe philosophies of the subject. Who could have thought he would haveslid away from her, on her first entrance into a house where she wouldhave to fight her way step by step, for nothing at all--for the firstnovelty that caught his wandering eye?Patty was tired, and she cried a little at this crisis, feeling that herfate was hard. To acquire a husband with so much trouble, and to findout at once how little help to her he was. He was very fond of her, sheknew. Still, now he was used to her, and took her for granted as a partof the order of things, he could not keep his mind fixed even on hiswife. He was only a Softy after all, nothing more! Patty roused herselfbriskly, however, from this line of thought, which was evidently not oneto encourage, and rang the bell. It remained a long time unanswered; andthen she rang again. This time the footman who had turned his back uponher at the carriage-door, came, looked in, said “Oh!” when he saw hersitting alone, and went away. Patty’s fury was indescribable. Oh thatdolt John Simpson, what a fate he was making for himself! While shewaited, growing more and more angry, Mrs. Osborne came in again, withhesitation. She was still in her outdoor dress, and looked disturbed andembarrassed.“The servants---- have told me---- that you had rung the bell,” shesaid, faltering considerably. “Is there---- anything---- I can order foryou?”Margaret was very little prepared for her _rôle_, and was as profoundlyaware of her own want of power as Patty could be.“Order for me!” said Patty. “I rang for tea, as a proper servant wouldhave known; and I wish you to know, Mrs. Osborne--if you are Mrs.Osborne, as I suppose, for no one has had the decency to introduceyou--that it is my place to give the orders, and not yours.”Margaret was so much taken by surprise that she had no weapon with whichto defend herself. She said mildly:--“I do not often give orders; but the housekeeper, who was my aunt’sfavourite maid, is much overcome. I will tell them--what you want.”“Thank you, I can tell them myself,” said Patty, ringing another, alouder, and more violent peal. It brought up the butler himself in greathaste, and it startled the still lingering visitors, who again thoughtnothing less than that Sir Giles must be taken ill. “Bring up teadirectly,” cried Mrs. Gervase. “This is the third time I have rung. Ipass over it now, owing to the confusion of the house, but it had betternot occur again.”The butler stared open-mouthed at the new-comer. Patty Hewitt, of theSeven Thorns! He knew her as well as he knew his own sister. Then helooked at Mrs. Osborne, who made him a slight sign--and thendisappeared, to carry astonishment and dismay into the servants’ hall.“Mrs. Osborne give me a nod,” said the angry dignitary, “as I had betterdo it. Lord! saucing me as have known her since she was _that_ high,setting up for my lady, as grand as grand, and the family giving in toher!”“The family!” said the cook, tossing her head; “call Mrs. Osborne thefamily, that is no better nor you and me. Far worse! A companion as isnobody, eating dirt to make her bread.”“Oh, if my poor lady had been here!” said Parsons, “that creature wouldsoon have been put to the door! She was too soft-hearted over Mr.Gervase, was my poor lady--but not to stand that. As for Miss Meg, shehasn’t got the spirit of a mouse!”“But what am I to do?” said Stevens, the butler. “Me, an old servant,ordered about and sauced like that! What am I to do, I ask you? Take upthe tea--or what? Mrs. Osborne, she give me a nod--but Mrs. Osborneshe’s not like Sir Giles’ daughter, and nobody has no authority. What amI to do?”It was finally resolved in that anxious conclave that John should besent up with the tea, much to John’s mortification and alarm, who beganto feel that, perhaps, it might have been better to be civil to PattyHewitt. He went, but returned in a minute, flying along the passages,his face crimson, his eyes staring out of his head. “She says as I’mnever to show in her sight again!” he cried. “She says as how Mr.Stevens is to come hisself and do his duty: nor she didn’t say _Mr._Stevens either,” cried John, with momentary satisfaction, “but Stevens,short; and wouldn’t let me so much as put down the tray!”“Robert can take it,” said the butler; but he was bewildered andhesitated. Presently he followed with a sheepish air. “I’ll just go andsee what comes of it,” he said.Patty was sitting up very erect in her chair, a flame of battle on hercheeks. She allowed herself, however, to show a dignified relief whenStevens came in following his inferior, who carried the tray. It was notto be supposed that so great a man could bear that burden for himself:Patty recognised this fact with instant sympathy. She nodded her headwith dignity.“Stevens,” she said, with the air of a duchess, “you will see that thatman never comes into my sight again.”Stevens did not, indeed, make any reply, but a sound of consternationburst from him, a suspiration of forced breath, which Patty accepted asassent. Margaret was standing at a little distance speechless, an imageof confusion and embarrassment. She knew no more than the servants whatto do. Gervase’s wife--as there was no reason to doubt this womanwas--how could Gervase’s cousin oppose her? Margaret had no rights--noposition in the household; but the wife of Gervase had certainly rights,however inopportune might be the moment at which she chose to assertthem. Mrs. Osborne, however, started violently when she herself wasaddressed with engaging friendliness.“Won’t you come and have some tea? No? are you going? Then, will youplease tell Gervase that tea is here, and I am waiting for him?” Pattysaid.Margaret withdrew from the room as if a shot had been fired at her. Herconfusion and helplessness were so great that they went beyond anythinglike resentment. She was almost overawed by the boldness of the intruderand the impossibility of the situation. Gervase stood in the doorway,excited and pleased, shouting for the carriages, talking about thehorses to whoever would talk with him. She was glad of some excuse forcalling him, taking him by the arm. Certainly he would be betteranywhere than there.“Gervase,” she said, “tell me, is that your wife who is in the library?”“Eh? What do you say, Meg? Patty? Why, of course! What did you think shecould be? Patty! look here, you come and tell Meg----”“Hush, Gervase, she wants you to go to her. Tea is ready, and she iswaiting for you. Now go, Gervase, go--do go!”“She’s come over Meg, too!” said Gervase to himself with a chuckle; and,fortunately, his amusement in that, and the impulse of his cousin’stouch on his arm, and the new suggestion which, whatever it happened tobe, was always powerful with him, made him obey the call which now cameout shrilly over the other noises from the library door.“Gervase! Gervase! I’m waiting for you for tea.”Margaret crossed the hall into the morning-room, with a grave face. Theconsternation which was in her whole aspect moved Colonel Piercey, whofollowed her, to a short laugh. “What is to be done?” he said.“Oh, nothing, nothing that I know of! Of course she is Gervase’swife--she has a right to be here. I don’t know what my poor uncle willsay--but I told you before he would be talked over.”“She showed herself very ready and with all her wits about her, at thedoor.”“Yes,” said Margaret. “She has a great deal of sense, I have alwaysheard. It may not be a bad thing after all.”“It frightens you, however,” Colonel Piercey said.“Not frightens but startles me--very much: and then, poor Aunt Piercey!Poor Aunt Piercey! her only child, and on her funeral day.”“She was not a wise mother, I should imagine.”“What does that matter?” cried Margaret. “And who is wise? We do what wethink is the best, and it turns out the worst. How can we tell? I amglad she is gone, at least, and did not see it,” she cried with a fewhot tears.Colonel Piercey looked at her coldly, as he always did. It was on hislips to say, “She was not very good to you, that you should shed tearsfor her,” but he refrained. He could not refrain, however, fromsaying--which was perhaps worse--“I am afraid it is a thing which willmuch affect you.”“Oh, me!” she cried, with a sort of proud disdain, and turned and lefthim without a word. Whatever happened he was always her hardest andcoldest judge, suggesting meanness in her conduct and thoughts even toherself.CHAPTER XXV.No house could be more agitated and disturbed than was Greyshott on thenight of Lady Piercey’s funeral. That event, indeed, was enough to throwa heavy cloud over the dwelling, where the imperious old lady had filledso large a place, that the mere emptiness, where her distinct andimposing figure was withdrawn, touched the imagination, even if it didnot touch the heart. The impression, however, on such an occasion isgenerally one of subdued quiet and gloom--an arrest of life; whereas thegreat house was quivering with fears and suppositions, with theexcitement of a struggle which nobody could see the end of, or divinehow it should turn. The servants were in a ferment, some of themexpecting dismissal; others agreed that under new sway, such as seemedto threaten, Greyshott would not be a place for them. The scene in thehousekeeper’s room, where the heads of the female department sattogether dismayed, and exchanged presentiments and resolutions, wastragic in its intensity of alarm and wrath. The cook had not given morethan a passing thought to the dinner, which an eager kitchen-maid on herpromotion had the charge of; and Parsons sat arranging her lists oflinen with a proud but melancholy certainty that all would be foundright, however hastily her reign might be brought to an end.“I never thought as I should have to give them up to the likes of her,”Parsons said, among her tears. “Oh, my lady, my poor lady! She’s beentook away from the evil to come.”“She’d never have let the likes of her step within our doors,” saidcook, indignant, “if it had only been poor Sir Giles, as is no betterthan a baby, that had been took, and my lady left to keep thingsstraight.”“Oh, don’t say that, cook, don’t say that,” cried Parsons, “for then_he’d_ have been Sir Gervase, and _she_ Lady Piercey, and my lady wouldhave--bursted; that’s what she would have done.”“Lord!” cried the cook, “Lady Piercey! But the Colonel or somebody wouldhave stopped that.”“There’s nobody as could have stopped it,” said Parsons, betterinformed. “They might say as he hadn’t his wits, and couldn’t manage hisproperty, or that--but to stop him from being Sir Gervase, and her LadyPiercey, is what nobody can do; no, not the Queen, nor the Parliament:for he was born to that: Softy or not it don’t make no difference.”“Lord!” said the cook again: and she took an opportunity shortly afterof going into the kitchen and giving a look at the dinner, of which thatambitious, pushing kitchen-maid was making a _chef-d’œuvre_. The sameinformation filtering through the house made several persons nervous.Simpson, the footman, for one, gave himself up for lost; and any othermember of the household who had ever entered familiarly at the SevenThorns, or given a careless order for a pot of beer to Patty, now shookin his shoes. The general sentiments at first had been those ofindignation and scorn; but a great change soon came over thehousehold--a universal thrill of alarm, a sense of insecurity. No oneventured now to mention the name of Patty. _She_, they called her withawe--and in the case of some far-seeing persons, like that kitchen-maid,the intruder had already received her proper name of Mrs. Gervase, oreven Lady Gervase, from those whose education was less complete.The sensation of dismay which thus pervaded the house attained, perhaps,its climax in the rooms which Margaret Osborne shared with her boy, andwhere she had withdrawn after her brief intercourse with Patty. Theserooms were little invaded by the rest of the household, the nurse whotook care of Osy, doing everything that was needed for her mistress, andthe little apartment making a sort of sanctuary for the mother and thechild. She was sure of quiet there if nowhere else; and when she hadclosed the door she seemed for a moment to leave behind her all theagitations which convulsed and changed the course of life. The tworooms, opening into one another, in which Margaret’s life had been spentfor years, which were almost the only home that Osy had ever known, werestill hers, though she could not tell for how short a time: the swordhanging over the mantelpiece, which Osy had described as the only thingwhich belonged to his mother and himself, hung there still, their symbolof individual possession. For years past, Margaret had felt herself safewhen she closed that door. She held it, as it now appeared, on but aprecarious footing; but she had not thought so up to this time. She hadfelt that she had a right to her shelter, that her place was one whichnobody could take from her; not the right of inheritance, it is true,but of nature. It was the home of her fathers, though she was only SirGiles’ niece, and bore another name. She had been a dependant indeed,but not as a stranger would be. It was the home of her childhood, and itwas hers as long as the old rule continued--the natural state of affairswhich she had not thought of as coming to an end. Even Lady Piercey’sdeath had not appeared to her to make an end. Sir Giles would need hermore: there would be still more occasion for her presence in the housewhen the imperious, but not unkind, mistress went away. The old lady hadbeen sharp in speech, and careless of her feelings, but she had neverforgotten that Meg Piercey had a right to her shelter as well as dutiesto discharge there. There had been, indeed, a scare about Gervase, butit was a proof of the slightness of reality in that scare that Margarethad scarcely thought of it as affecting herself. She had been eager tobring back Gervase to his mother, if by no other means, by the help ofPatty, thus recognising her position; but after Lady Piercey’s death,when the necessity was no longer pressing, Margaret had thought of it nomore. And, certainly, of all days in the world, it was not upon the dayof the funeral that she had looked for any disturbance in her life.But now in a moment--in the time that sufficed to open a door, to ring abell, to give an order--Mrs. Osborne recognised that this life was over.It had seemed as if it must never come to an end, as all established andsettled existence does; and now in a moment it had come to an end. Atmany moments, when her patience was strained to the utmost, Margaret hadcome up here and composed herself, and felt herself safe within thesewalls. As long as she had this refuge she could bear anything, and therehad been no likelihood that it would be taken from her. But now,whatever she might have to bear, it seemed certain that it was not hereshe could retire to reconcile herself to it. It seemed scarcely possibleto believe that the old order of affairs was over; and yet she feltconvinced that it was over and could return no more. She did not as yetask herself what she should do. She had never acted for herself, neverinquired into the possibilities of life. Captain Osborne’s widow hadcome back to her home as the only natural thing to do. She had beenbrought up to do Lady Piercey’s commands, to be the natural,superfluous, yet necessary, person who had no duty save to do duty foreverybody; and she had fallen back into that position as if it were theonly one in life. Margaret did not enter into any questions with herselfeven now, much less come to any decision. It was enough for one day tohave faced the startling, incomprehensible fact that her life was over,the only life--except that brief episode of her marriage--which she hadever known. Where was she to go with her little pension, her husband’ssword, and her boy? But she could not tell, or even think, as yet, ofany step to take. All that she was capable of was to feel that thepresent existence, the familiar life, was at an end.Osy had been left in a secluded corner of the garden while the funeraltook place, to be out of the way. It had not seemed necessary to hismother to envelop him in mourning, and take him with her through thatstrange ceremonial, so mysterious to childish thoughts; and while shesat alone, the sound of his little voice and step became audible to hercoming up the stairs. Osy, who was willing on ordinary occasions tospend the whole of his time out-of-doors, had been impatient to-day,touched by the prevailing agitation, though he did not know what itmeant. He came in, stamping with his little feet, making up for thequiet which had been exacted from him for a few days past, and threwhimself against Margaret’s knee.“Movver,” he said, breathless, “there’s a lady down in the libery.”“Yes, Osy, I know.”“Oh, movver knows,” he said, turning to his attendant, “I told youmovver alvays knows. Very queer fings,” said Osy, reflectively, “havetummed to pass to-day.”“What things, Osy?”“Fings about Aunt Piercey,” said the little boy, counting upon hisfingers; “somefing I don’t understand. You said, movver, she had don toheaven, but Parsons, she said you had all don to put her somewhere else,but I believe you best; and then there were all the carriages and thegemplemans, and the horse that runned away. But most strangest of all,the lady in the libery.” He paused to think. “I fought she wasn’t a ladyat all, but a dressmaker or somefing.”“And then? you changed your mind?”“No,” said the little boy, doubtfully, “not me. But she looked out ofthe window, and then she called, ‘Gervase! Gervase!’--she touldn’t say,Gervase, Gervase, if she were one of the maids. I fink it’s the ladyCousin Gervase went to London to marrwy. And I’m glad,” Osy said, makinganother pause. He resumed, “I’m glad, because now I know that my bigsilver piece was a marrwage present, movver. He tooked it, but I dave ithim all the same; and as it was a marrwage present, I don’t mindscarcely at all. But that is not the funniest fing yet,” said Osy,putting up his hand to his mother’s face to secure her attention;“there’s somefing more, movver. She tummed to the window, and she said,‘Gervase, Gervase, who is that ickle boy?’”“Well, Osy, there was nothing very wonderful in that,” said Margaret,trying to smile.“Yes, mower, there was two fings wonderful.” He held out the small dirtyforefinger again, and tapped upon it with the forefinger of his otherlittle fat hand. “First--there touldn’t any lady tum to Greyshott andnot know me. I’m not an ickle boy, I’m Osy; and another fing, she knowsme already quite well; for she isn’t a beau’ful lady from London, likethat one that singed songs, you know. She is the woman at the SevenThorns. Sally, tum here and tell movver. We knowed her quite well, bofSally and me.”“It’s quite true, ma’am, as Mr. Osy says, it’s quite, quite----”“That will do,” said Margaret, “I want no information on the subject.Make haste, Sally, and get Master Osy’s tea.”Osy stood looking up somewhat anxiously in his mother’s face, leaningagainst her. He put one hand into hers, and put the other to her chin tomake her look at him, with a way he had. “Movver, why don’t you wantin--in--formashun?” he said.“Osy, my little boy, you know you mustn’t talk before Sally of yourCousin Gervase or the family; you must tell me whatever happens, but notany of the servants. That lady is perhaps going to be the lady of thehouse, now. She is Mrs. Gervase, and she has a better right to be herethan you or me. Perhaps we shall have to go away. You must be a verygood, very thoughtful little boy; and polite, like a gentleman, to everyone.”“I am never not a gemplemans, movver,” said the child, with an air ofoffended dignity; then he suddenly grew red, and cried out, “Oh, Ifordot! Cousin Colonel met me in the hall, and he said would I tell youto tum, please, and speak to him in the rose-garden, because he touldn’ttum upstairs. Will you do and speak to Cousin Colonel in the garden,movver? He said, wouldn’t I tum with him to his house?”“Osy! but you wouldn’t go with any one, would you, away from yourmother?”“Oh, not for always,” cried the child, “but for a day, two days, to rideupon his s’oulder. He’s not like Cousin Gervase. He holds fast--fast;and I likes him. Movver, run into the rose-garden; for I fordot, and heis there waiting, and he will fink I’ve broke my word. And I doesn’twant you now,” said Osy, waving his hand, “for I’m doin’ to have mytea.”Thus dismissed, Margaret rose slowly and with reluctance. She did notrun to the rose-garden as her son had bidden her. A cloud had come overher face. It was quite reasonable that Colonel Piercey should ask tospeak with her in her changed position of affairs. It would be quitereasonable, indeed, that he should offer her advice, or even help. Hewas her nearest relation, and though he had not been either just or kindto herself, he had fallen under the charm of her little boy. It might bethat, distasteful as it was, for Osy’s sake she would have to accept,even to seek, Gerald Piercey’s advice. Probably it was true kindness onhis part to offer it in the first place, to put himself at her disposal.For herself there could be no such question; somehow, so far as she wasconcerned, she could struggle and live or die: what would it matter? ButOsy must grow up, must be educated, must become a man. Margaret had beenof opinion that she knew something already of the bitterness ofdependence; it seemed to her now, however, that she had not tasted ituntil this day.END OF VOL. I.CHAPTER XXVI.Colonel Piercey had been walking up and down somewhat impatiently forsome time, at the corner of the rose-garden where Osy had left him. Thechild had not then seen the lady at the window who asked who was thatlittle boy; and this incident and the account of it, which Osy hadhastened to give to his mother, had naturally occupied some time. He wasnot much accustomed to wait, and did not like it. And when he sawMargaret come slowly along, some half-hour after he had sent, what hefelt was a very respectful message to her, asking her to allow him a fewminutes’ conversation, the curious opposition and sense of inevitablehostility which he felt towards his cousin, was sharpened into a keenfeeling of resentment. She had held him at bay all along, never treatedhim with confidence or friendliness; and if she chose to affectfine-lady airs of coyness and pride _now_! It was quite unconsciously tohimself, and he was by nature a man full of generosity, who would havebeen more astonished than words could say, had he been charged withpresuming upon adverse circumstances; and yet he was far more angry withMargaret in her dependent position than he would have been with anywoman more happily situated. He felt that she, as women he believedgenerally did, was disposed to stand upon the superiority of being at sogreat a disadvantage, and to claim consideration from the very fact thatshe got it from no one. Why should she bear the spurns of all theunworthy, and mount upon that pedestal of patient merit to him? It wasnot that he felt it natural to treat her badly because other people did,but because the fact that other people did, gave her the opportunity ofassuming that it would be the same with him. He would have liked to takeher by the shoulders and shake out of her that aspect of injury, withoutknowing that he dared not have entertained that fierce intention towardsany one who was not injured. Finally, he watched her coming towards himslowly, showing her reluctance in every step, with an impatience anddisinclination to put up with it, which was almost stronger than anyfeeling of personal opposition he had ever felt in his life. She said,before she had quite come up to him: “I am sorry I have kept youwaiting. Osy has only given me your message now.”It was on his lips to say: “You are not sorry to have kept me waiting!”but he subdued that impulse. A man like Colonel Piercey cannot give awoman the lie direct, unless in very serious circumstances indeed. Hereplied stiffly: “I fear I have taken a great liberty in asking you tomeet me here at all.”Margaret answered only with a faint smile and wave of her hand, whichseemed to Colonel Piercey to say as plainly as words: “Everybody offersme indignity; why not you, too?” which, perhaps, was not very far fromthe fact; though she was a great deal too proud to have ever said, oreven implied, anything of the kind. He answered his own suppositionhotly, by saying: “I know no other place where we should be safe frominterruption, and I thought it my duty to---- speak to you about the newcondition of affairs.”“Yes?” said Margaret. “I am afraid I have very little light to throw onthe position; but I shall be glad to hear what you have to say.”All that he said in the meantime was, with some resentment: “You don’tseem so much startled by what has happened as I should have supposed.”“I was much startled to see Patty--I mean the person whom we must nowcall Mrs. Gervase--at the funeral. But of course, after that, one wasprepared for all the rest. I don’t know that I had much reason to bestartled even at that. From the moment we found that she was absentwhile he was absent, I ought to have, and indeed I did, divine what musthave occurred. However sure one is of such a thing, it is startling, allthe same, when one comes to see it actually accomplished; but I oughtnot to say more than that.”“You take it with much philosophy,” Colonel Piercey said.“Do you think so? I should be glad to think I was so strong-minded; forthere is probably no one to whom it will make so much difference as tome.”“That is why I felt that I must speak to you. Can nothing be done toprevent this?”“To prevent what?” she said, with some surprise.“The reign of this woman over Uncle Giles’ house, in Aunt Piercey’splace! It is too intolerable; it is enough to make the old lady risefrom her grave.”“Poor old Aunt Piercey! She has been taken away from the evil to come. Iam glad that she is dead, and has not had this to bear.”“I suppose women have tears at their will,” cried Colonel Piercey,bursting forth in an impatience which he could restrain no longer. “Shewas not so kind to you that you should feel so tenderly for her.”“How do you know she was not kind to me? She was natural, at allevents,” cried Margaret. “It has all been quite natural up to this time;I went away and I came back, and whatever happened to me, I was at home.But you, Colonel Piercey, you are not natural. I have no right to acceptcontumely at your hands. You came here with a suspicion of Heaven knowswhat in your mind; you thought I had some design: what was the designwhich you suspected me of having against the happiness of thishousehold? I warned you that you should have some time or other toexplain what you meant--to me.”Colonel Piercey stood confronting her among the roses which formed soinappropriate a background, and did not know what reply to make. He hadnot expected that assault. Answer to a man for whatever you have said orseemed to say, and whatever may lie behind, that is simple enough; butto explain your injurious thoughts to a woman, who does not even softenthe situation by saying that she has no one to protect her--that is adifferent matter. He grew red, and then grew grey. He had no more notionwhat to answer to her than he had what it was, actually and as a matterof fact, that he had suspected. He had not suspected anything. He hadfelt that a woman like this could never have accepted the position ofdependence, unless---- That such a person must be a dangerous andhostile force--that she had wrongs to redress, a position to make--howcould he tell? It had been instinctive, he had never known what hethought.“Cousin Meg----” he said, hesitating.“From the moment,” she said indignantly, “in which you set me up as aschemer and designing person in the home that sheltered me, these termsof relationship have been worse than out of place.”Poor Colonel Piercey! He was as far from being a coward as a man couldbe. If he did not write V.C. after his name, it was, perhaps, becausethe opportunity had not come to him of acquiring that distinction; hewas the kind of man of which V.C.'s are made. But now, no expedient,save that of utter cowardice, occurred to him; for the first time inhis life he ran away.“I am very sorry you will not accord me these terms,” he said, meekly;“I don’t understand what you accuse me of. _I_ think you a schemer anddesigning person! how could I? If you will excuse me, there is no sensein such a suggestion. Unless I had been a fool--and I hope, at least,that you don’t consider me a fool--how could I have thought anything ofthe kind? You must think me either mad or an idiot,” he went on, gaininga little courage. “I came here with no suspicions. I have been angry,”he added, turning his head away, “to see my cousin, Meg Piercey, ateverybody’s beck and call, and to see how careless they were of you, andhow exacting, and how----”“All this,” said Margaret, with surprise, “should have made you lookupon me with compassion instead of something like insult.”“Oh, compassion,” he cried, “to you! I should have thought that theworst insult of all. You are not a person to be pitied. However I mayhave offended, I have always felt that----”The end of this statement was part of the process of running away.Indeed, he was very much frightened, and felt the falseness of hisposition extremely. He had not a word to say for himself. To upbraidher--at a moment when her home, her last shelter, was probably about tobe taken from her, and herself thrown upon the world with her helplesschild--he, perhaps, being the only person who had any right to helpher--was the most impossible thing in the world. And though his opinionhad no time or occasion to have changed, it had always been an opinionfounded upon nothing. A more curious state of mind could scarcely be. Hewas dislodged from his position at the point of Margaret’s sword, so tospeak. And he had never had any ground for that position, or right tohave assumed it; and yet he was still there in mind, though in word andprofession he had run away. Margaret did not understand this complicatedstate of mind. She was half amused by the dismay in his face, by his tooswift and complete change of front. The _amende_ which he had made wasas complete as any apology and confession could be, though it was anapology by implication, rather than a direct denial of blame. “How couldI?” is different from “I did not.” But she did not dwell upon this.“Of course,” she said, “I have no right not to accept what you say,though it is, perhaps, strangely expressed. And I scarcely know whatthere is I can explain to you. My aunt feared this that has taken place,before I did: she naturally thought less of her son’s deficiencies. Shewas so imprudent, as I thought it, as to warn the girl of things shewould do to prevent it. I believe there was really nothing that couldhave been done to prevent it. And then she was equally imprudent inletting him go to town, and thus giving him the opportunity. She thoughtshe could secure him by putting him in the hands of the clergyman, whonever saw him at all. I feared very much how it would be, and poorGervase was several times on the point of betraying himself. Perhaps, ifI had sought his confidence---- But his mother would not have paid anyattention to what I could say. And I don’t know what could have beendone to prevent it.”“Why, he is next to an idiot!”“Oh no,” cried Margaret, half offended. “Gervase is not an idiot. He hasgleams of understanding, quite--almost, as clear as any one. He knowswhat he wants, and though you may think his mind has no steadiness, youwill find he always comes back to his point. He has a kind ofcleverness, even, at times. Oh no; Aunt Piercey examined into all that.They could not make him out incapable of managing his own affairs. To besure, he has not had any to manage up to this time. And now that he hasthis sharp Patty behind him,” said Margaret, with a half smile----“Then you think nothing can be done?”“What could be done? You could not do anything in Uncle Giles’ lifetimeto turn his only child out of his inheritance.”“It is you,” said Colonel Piercey, “who are imputing intentions now. Ihad no such idea. I think my business as next-of-kin is to defend thepoor fellow. But the woman; that is a different thing.”“The woman is his wife. I don’t want to assume any unnaturalimpartiality. But, after all, is he likely ever to have had a betterwife? I believe she will be an excellent wife to Gervase. One of hisown class, I hope, would not have married him.”“Why do you say, ‘I hope?’ Is that not worse than anything that could besaid?”“Perhaps,” said Margaret. “Poor Gervase is not an idiot, but neither ishe just like other people. And a girl might have been driven into it,and then might have found----” She added, with a little shiver, “It isthe best thing that could have happened for him to marry Patty. I hateit, of course. How could I do otherwise? But as far as he himself isconcerned----”“You are a great philosopher, Cousin Meg.”“Do you think so?” Half resentful as she was, and not more than halfsatisfied with Colonel Piercey’s explanations, he was yet the onlyperson in the world to whom she could speak with freedom; and it was arelief to her. “She will look after Uncle Giles’ comfort, and he willget to like her,” she continued. “She will rule the household with a rodof iron.” Margaret laughed, though her face settled down the next momentinto a settled gravity. “They will have no society, but they will notwant it. She will keep them amused. Perhaps it is the best thing thatcould have happened,” she said.“And you? and the boy?” He stopped and looked at her standing among theroses, which were very luxuriant in the last climax of maturity, fullblown, shedding their leaves, just about to topple over from that heightof life into the beginning of decay. Margaret had no trace of decayabout her, but she, too, was in the full height of life, the fulfilmentof promise, standing at the _mezzo di cammin_, and full of allcapabilities. She did not look up at him, but answered with ahalf-smile,--“I--and the boy? We are not destitute. Perhaps it will be better for usboth to set out together, and live our own life.”“You are not destitute? I hope you will pardon me. After what you thinkmy conduct has been, you may say I have no right----”Margaret smiled in spite of herself.“But you say that your conduct has been--not what I thought.”“Yes, yes, that is so: I have not been such a fool. Cousin Meg, we weregreat friends in the old days.”“Not such very great friends--no more than girls and boys are when theyare not specially attached to each other.”He thought that she intended to give him a little prick with one ofthose thorns which the matured rose still keeps upon its stalk; and hefelt the prick, which, being still more mature than she, he ought not tohave done.“I think it was a little more than that,” he said, in a slight tone ofpique; “but anyhow--we are cousins.”“Very distant cousins.”“Distant cousins,” he cried, impatiently, “are near when there are nonearer between. We are of the same blood, at least. You want to push meaway, to make me feel I have nothing to do with it; but that can’t beso long as you are Meg Piercey----”“Margaret Osborne at your service,” she said, gravely. “Forgive me,Cousin Gerald. It is true, we have had enough of this tilting. I don’tdoubt for a moment that you would give me a helping hand if you could;that you wish me well, and especially,” she added, lifting her eyes witha half reproach, half gratitude in them, “the boy--as you call him.”“What could I call him but the boy?” said Colonel Piercey, with a sortof exasperation. “Yes, I don’t deny it, it was of him I wanted to speak.He is a delightful boy--he is full of faculty and capacity, and onecould make anything of him. Let me say quite sincerely what I think. Youare not destitute; but you are not rich enough to give him the best ofeverything in the way of education, as--as--don’t slay me with a flashof lightning--as I could. Now I have said it! If you would trust him tome!”She had looked, indeed, for a moment as if her eyes could give forthlightning enough to have slain any man standing defenceless before her;but then these eyes softened with hot tears. She kept looking at theman, explaining himself with such difficulty, putting forth his offer ofkindness as if it were some dreadful proposition, with a gradual meltingof the lines in her face. When he threw a hasty glance at her at the endof his speech, she seemed to him a woman made of fire, shedding lightabout her in an astonishing transfiguration such as he had never seenbefore.“This,” she said, in a low voice, “is the most terrible demonstration ofmy poverty and helplessness that has ever been made to me--and the mostawful suggestion, as of suicide and destruction.”“Meg!”“Don’t, don’t interrupt me! It is: I have never known how little good Iwas before. I don’t know now if it will kill me, or sting me to life;but all the same,” she cried, her lip quivering, “you are kind, and Ithank you with all my heart! and I will promise you this: If I find, asyou think, that, whatever I may do, I cannot give my Osy the educationhe ought to have, I will send and remind you of your offer. I hope youwill have children of your own by that time, and perhaps you will haveforgotten it.”“I shall not forget it; and I am very unlikely to have children of myown.”“Anyhow, I will trust you,” she said, “and I thank you with all myheart, though you are my enemy. And that is a bargain,” she said,holding out her hand.Her enemy! Was he her enemy? And yet it seemed something else beside.CHAPTER XXVII.While these scenes were going on, Mr. and Mrs. Gervase Piercey were verydifferently employed upstairs. When Patty had finished her tea, and whenshe had made the survey of the library, concerning which her conclusionwas that these horrid bookcases must be cleared away, and that afull-length portrait of herself in the white satin which had not, yetought to have been, her wedding-dress, would do a great deal for thecheerfulness of the room, she took her husband’s arm, and desired him toconduct her over the house. When Patty saw the drawing-room, which wasvery large, cold, and light in colour, with chairs and chandeliers inbrown holland, she changed her mind about the library. She had not beenaware of the existence of this drawing-room.“This is where we shall sit, of course,” she said.“Father can’t abide it,” said Gervase.“Oh, your father is a very nice old gentleman. He will have to put upwith it,” said the new lady of the house.In imagination she saw herself seated there, receiving the county, andthe spirit of Patty was uplifted. She felt, for the first time, withoutany admixture of disappointment, that here was her sphere. When she wastaken upstairs, however, to Gervase’s room, she regarded it by no meanswith the same satisfaction. It was a large room, but sparsely furnished,in no respect like the luxurious bower she had imagined for herself.“Take off my bonnet here!” she said: “no, indeed I sha’n’t. Why, thereis not even a drapery to the toilet table. I have not come to Greyshott,I hope, to have less comfort than I had at home. There must be sparerooms. Take me to the best of the spare rooms.”“There’s the prince’s room,” said Gervase, “but nobody sleeps theresince some fellow of a prince--I can’t tell you what prince---- And Ihaven’t got the keys; it’s Parsons that has got the keys.”“You can call Parsons, I suppose. Ring the bell,” said Patty, seizingthe opportunity to look at herself in the glass, though she surveyed theroom with contempt.“Lord!” cried Gervase. “Parsons, mother’s own woman----.” Then he threwhimself down in his favourite chair with his hands in his pockets. “Youcan do it yourself. I’m not going to catch a scolding for you.”“A scolding!” said Patty; “and who is going to scold you, you sillyfellow, except me? I should like to see them try--Mrs. Parsons or SirGiles, or any one. You can just say, ‘Speak to my wife.’”“There’s mother, that you daren’t set up your face to. I say,” saidGervase; “Patty, what’s all this about mother? Mother’s--dead? She’llnever have a word to say about anything any more?”“Dear mother!” said Patty. “You must always say dear mother, Gervase,now: I’m sure I should have loved her--but, you see, Providence nevergave me the opportunity. No, she’ll never have a word to say: it’s methat will have everything to say.--Oh, you have answered the bell atlast! Send Mrs. Parsons here.”“Mrs. Parsons, ma’am--my lady?” the frightened little under-housemaid,who had been made to answer, said.Patty gave her a gracious smile, feeling that at last she had found someone who understood what her claims were.“What’s your name?” she said.“Ellen.”“Well, Ellen, I like your looks, and I’ve no doubt we shall get on; butyou needn’t call me my lady, not now,--for the present I am only Mrs.Gervase. Now, go and send Parsons here.”“Oh, my lady, Mrs. Parsons! she’s in my old lady’s room. I daren’tdisturb her, not for anything in the world; it would be as much as myplace was worth.”“I see you are only a little fool after all,” said Patty, with a frown.“Your place is just worth this much--whether you please me or not. Mrs.Parsons has as much power as--as that table. Goodness,” cried Patty,“what a state this house has been in, to be sure, when one servant isafraid of another! but I shall soon put an end to that. Call Parsons!let her come at once.”The little housemaid came back while Patty still stood before the glassstraightening the edge of her bonnet and arranging her veil.“If you please, my lady, Mrs. Parsons is doing out my old lady’sdrawers--and she has her head bent down, and I can’t make her hear.”“I’ll make her hear,” cried Patty, with an impulse which belonged ratherto her previous condition than to her present dignity; and she rushedalong the corridor like a whirlwind, with her draperies flying. It was,doubtless, instinct or inspiration that directed her to the right door,while Gervase followed on her steps to see the fun, with a grin upon hisface. He remembered only now and then, when something recalled it tohim, that his mother was gone. He was not thinking of her now;nevertheless, when Patty burst into that room, he stood in the doorwaydumb, the grin dying out from his face, and gave a scared look round asif looking for the familiar presence he had so often encountered there.“You perhaps have not heard, Mrs. Parsons,” said Patty, with her sharp,decisive voice, “that I sent for you?”Parsons had her head bent over the drawers. She said, without turninground, “That gaby, Ellen, said something about somebody wanting me”; andthen began to count,--“Eight, nine, ten. Three dozen here and threedozen in the walnut wardrobe,” said Parsons; “that makes it just right.”Patty’s curiosity overcame her resentment. She came forward and lookedover Parsons’ shoulder. “Six dozen silk stockings,” she cried; “is thatwhat you are counting? What a number for an old lady! and fine, too, andin good condition,” she said, putting her hand over the woman’s shoulderand bringing forth a handful. They were mingled white and black, andPatty looked upon them with covetous eyes.“Who are you as takes such a liberty?” cried Parsons, springing to herfeet. She found herself confronted by Patty’s very alert, firm figureand resolute countenance. Patty drew Lady Piercey’s silk stockingsthrough her hands, looking at the size of them. She held them up by thetoes to mark her sense of their enormous dimensions.“I could put both my feet into one of them,” she said, reflectively, “sothat they are no use to me. Oh, you are Parsons! Open the door, please,at once, of the best rooms. I want to settle down.”The woman looked at the intruder with a mixture of defiance and fear.She turned to Gervase, appealing against the stranger. Many a time hadParsons put the Softy out of his mother’s room, bidding him be off andnot aggravate my lady. But my lady was gone, and Gervase was themaster, to do what he would; or, what was worse, it was Patty who wasthe mistress. Patty of the ale-house! Parsons looked at Gervase with anagonised appeal. “They’re your mother’s things,” she said; “Mr. Gervase,will you see them knock about your mother’s things?”Patty’s eyes were in the drawer remarking everything, and those eyessparkled and shone. What treasures were there! Not only silk stockingstoo big for her, but linen, and lace, and embroidered handkerchiefs, andsilks, such as Patty had never seen before. She went to the drawers andclosed them one after another.“I see there are some nice things here,” she said. “We can’t have themturned over like this by a servant. Some servants expect theirmistress’s things as their perquisites, but we can’t allow that in thishouse. Lock them up, lock them up at once, and I’ll take the keys.”“The keys--my keys!” cried Parsons almost beside herself.“The late Lady Piercey’s keys. I’ll take them, please, all of them.There’s a time for everything; and to go over my mother-in-law’s thingsthe very day of her funeral is indecent--that is what it is, indecent; Ican find no other word.”“I’ll never give up my keys!” cried Parsons, “that my dear lady trustedme with--never, never!” And then she burst into tears, and flung themdown on the floor at Gervase’s feet. “Take them all, then! all!” shecried; “I’ll not keep one of them! Oh, my dear old lady, what a goodthing she has not lived to see this day! But it never would havehappened had she been here. You never, never would have dared to lift upyour little impudent face.--Oh, Mr. Gervase! oh, Mr. Gervase, save mefrom her! She’ll tear me to pieces!” Parsons cried. No doubt Patty’slook was fierce. The woman seized hold upon Gervase and swung herselfout by him, keeping his limp person between her and his wife. “Don’t lether!” she cried, “don’t let her! in your own mother’s room.”“Mrs. Parsons,” said Patty, over Gervase’s body as it were, “do youthink I would soil my fingers by touching you? You thought you would robthe poor lady that’s dead, and that nobody would notice; but you did notknow that _I_ was here. Instead of rummaging Lady Piercey’s drawers, youhad better empty your own, and get ready for leaving. Have all youraccounts ready and your keys ready; you shall leave this house by twelveto-morrow,” Patty cried.“Mr. Gervase, Mr. Gervase!” cried the unfortunate woman.“I say, don’t you go and touch me, Parsons. I don’t mind your talking,but you sha’n’t go and finger me as if I was clothes from the wash,”said Gervase. He laughed at his own joke with enjoyment. “As if I was abasket of clothes from the wash,” he said.“Shut the door upon her, Gervase. I don’t condescend to bandy words.--Attwelve to-morrow,” Patty said.Parsons went downstairs mad with fury, and was told the tale of the tea,and how John Simpson had got his dismissal, and was never to appearbefore that upstart more. “We had better all give warning afore shecomes to the rest of us,” said cook. But it was a good place, with manyperquisites, and as she spoke she exchanged with the butler a look ofsome anxiety. Perhaps they did not wish to present their accounts at amoment’s notice. Perhaps they only thought regretfully of their goodplace. Parsons had carried things with a high hand over the youngerservants for years. She had not always even respected thesusceptibilities of cook. She had been her mistress’s favourite andcompanion, doing, they all thought, very much what she liked with theinternal economy of the house. No one had ventured to contradict, oreven oppose, Lady Piercey’s factotum. It was not in human nature not tobe pleased, more or less, that she had found some one to repay to her ina certain degree the little tyrannies of the past. “What would Mr.Dunning say?” was what everybody asked.The house was, however, in great agitation as the hour of dinnerapproached, and the drama of the family was about to be exposed to thesearching observation of that keen audience which waits at table, andwhich had all its faculties sharpened for this, its chief moment ofspectatorship. To have this mode and period of watching the crisis oflife in other human creatures, must be a great _dédommagement_ for anyills that may pertain to domestic service in these days. It is as goodas a play, nay, better, seeing that there is no simulation in thehistory that is worked out under our servants’ eyes. It was exciting tothink, even, how many places should be laid at table; whether Patty,whose new dignity had not been formally announced to any one, and, who,for anything they knew, might shrink from appearing in the midst of thefamily, unsupported--might not withdraw from the ordeal of the commonmeal, or be too much overcome with grief to come downstairs. Patty’smind was greatly exercised on the same subject. She had chosen fromamong the unoccupied rooms those which pleased her best, which were not,however, the prince’s rooms, but a suite adjoining which took her fancy,the size and the fittings of which, however, suggested innumerable newideas to a mind open and eager to receive every indication of what wassuitable to her new state. For one thing, they were lined withprodigious wardrobes: _miles_, Patty said to herself with awe, of olddark, gleaming, mahogany doors, behind which were pegs and shelvesinnumerable, to contain the dresses of the inhabitant. Patty could counthers--and only two, or at most, three of these were fit for the use ofMrs. Gervase Piercey--on one hand; and the long range of empty space atonce depressed and excited her--a vacancy that must be filled. In likemanner, the large dressing-table had drawers for jewellery, of whichPatty had none. And in this great space, where her little figure wasvisible in glimpses in two or three tall mirrors, there was such evidentneed of a maid, that her alert spirit was overawed by the necessity.Then she had nothing that was needful for the toilet: no shoes, not evena fresh handkerchief to dry those tears, which were ready to come at themention of her dear mother-in-law’s name. The temptation to return tothat dear mother-in-law’s room, and equip herself with those articleswhich lay there in such abundance, and which certainly, it would harm noone to make use of, was very strong. But Patty was half-afraid,half-conscious, that on this evening, at least, it would be unwise so tocompromise herself. It was not an evening, she reflected, for fulldress, and her mourning would be an excuse for everything. What a wiseinspiration that had been, to cover her old dress with crape! Pattyundid a hook or two, and folded in the corners of her bodice at theneck. It showed the whiteness of that throat, and gave an indicationthat she knew what was required in polite society. And she drew on againwith some difficulty, over hands which were not quite so presentable,the black gloves, which had not borne the strain of the morning, theheat, and the affliction, so well as might have been desired. Beforedoing this, however, she had written, by a sudden inspiration, a note toSally Fletcher, requesting her to come to Greyshott at once with Mrs.Gervase Piercey’s “things,” and to remain as her maid till furtherorders. And then she took her husband’s arm, and went solemnlydownstairs.Colonel Piercey was lingering in the hall, much at a loss what to do.Margaret had not yet appeared. The butler stood at the door of thedining-room, with Robert, not John Simpson, at his side. Patty knew thatit was correct and proper for the party to assemble first in thedrawing-room, but she waived that ceremony for to-night. She camedownstairs very audibly, describing to Gervase what she intended to do.“I can’t bear the gloomy library,” she said. “I don’t mean to sit in it.We must have the real drawing-room made fit to live in. But all thatwill want a little time, and, of course, your dear papa must beconsulted. I would not for the world interfere with his little ways.”“Where’s father? ain’t he coming to dinner?” said Gervase, breaking intothis speech, which the audience for which it was intended had alreadyheard, noted, and inwardly digested.“No, Mr. Gervase. Mr. Dunning things as Sir Giles ’as ’ad enoughexcitement for to-day.”“Well,” said Patty, “I don’t think much of Dunning after his neglect,but he’s right in that. I should have said so myself had it beenreferred to me. Early to bed and kept quite quiet--that is the onlything for your poor dear papa. Are we waiting for any one?” she said,looking round with majesty. _J’ai failli attendre_. Patty had neverheard these words, but they were written on her face.There was silence in the hall. Colonel Piercey had turned round from theengraving which he had been examining with quite unnecessary minuteness;but as he did not know either of the strange couple who by a suddentransformation had become his hosts, it was not possible that he couldgive any explanations; and the butler, who had not the training of amaster of the ceremonies, and who had begun to shake in his shoes beforethat personage who, in her day, had drawn beer for him at the SevenThorns--who had dismissed the great Parsons, and accused the greaterDunning of neglect--remained dumb, shifting from one foot to another,looking helplessly in front of him. He ventured at last to say, withtrepidation, that “Mrs. Osborne, if you please, is just comingdownstairs.”“Oh, Mrs. Osborne!” said Patty, and swept into the room. She stoodlooking for a moment at the expanse of the table laid with fiveplaces--one of them unnecessary. “I suppose I had better take my ownproper place at once without ceremony,” she said, with an airy gesture,half to Colonel Piercey, half to the butler. “And, Gervase, as yourfather isn’t here, you had better sit in his place. We must make anotherarrangement when Sir Giles is able to come to table. Oh, MargaretOsborne! Is that where she sits? And here she is! I don’t say anything,for we are a little unpunctual ourselves to-night. But I must warn youall that I am generally exact to the minute, and I never wait foranybody,” Patty said.CHAPTER XXVIII.It may easily be supposed that there was not much conversation at thetable thus surrounded. Colonel Piercey and Margaret Osborne sat oppositeto each other, but concealed from each other by the huge bouquet offlowers which occupied the central place; and neither of them, in theshock and strangeness of the occasion, found a word to say. They wereboth paralysed, so to speak, by the unimaginable circumstances in whichthey found themselves, overwhelmed with an amazement which grew as themeal went on. Gervase, in his father’s seat, ate voraciously, andlaughed a good deal, but said little. Patty was mistress of theoccasion. One glance of keen observation had shown her that Mrs.Osborne’s dress was not even open at the throat; it was not covered withcrape. It was the simplest of black gowns, with no special sign of“deep” mourning, such as on the evening of a funeral ought to have beenindispensable. If Patty had ever entertained any doubt of herself it nowvanished. It was she who was fulfilling all the duties necessary. Theothers were but outsiders. She had secured triumphantly her proper seatand sphere.“It is unfortunate for us, Gervase,” she said, “to come home on such asad day; and to think we knew nothing of all the dreadful things thatwere going on till we learned it all with a shock when we arrived! It istrue, we were moving about on our wedding-tour; but still, if the househadn’t been filled with those as--that--didn’t wish us well, we mighthave been called back; and you, dear, might have had the mournfulsatisfaction----”“You always said, Patty,” said Gervase, “that you would stay a weekaway.”“And to think of my poor dear mother-in-law looking for us, holding outher poor arms to us--and us knowing nothing,” said Patty, drying hereyes--“as if there were no telegraphs nor railways! Which makes it verysad for us to come home now; but I hope your dear father, Gervase, ifhe’s rightly watched and done for, won’t be any the worse. Oh, I hopenot! it would be too sad. That Dunning, who has been thought so much of,does not seem to me at all fit for his place. To think of him to-day,such an agitating day, with nothing to give his master! I shall take theliberty of superintending Mr. Dunning in future,” Patty said.Gerald Piercey and Margaret Osborne ate what was set before them humbly,without raising their eyes. They were ridiculously silenced and reducedto subjection; even if they could have encouraged each other with aglance it would have been something, but they had not even thatalleviation. What to say! They were ignored as completely as if theyhad been two naughty children. Gervase, more naughty still, but infavour, took advantage by behaving himself as badly as possible. He madesigns to the butler to pour him out wine with a liberal hand, andgobbled his food in great mouthfuls. “I say, Meg,” he whispered, puttinghis hand before his mouth, “don’t tell! she can’t see me!” while hiswife’s monologue ran on; and then he interrupted it with one of thoseboisterous laughs by which the Softy was known.“What is it?” Patty cried sharply from the head of the table.“Meg knows--Meg and me knows,” cried Gervase from the other end.“I must request,” said Patty, “Margaret Osborne, that you will not makemy husband forget, with your jokes, what day it is. You mayn’t think it,perhaps, for my poor dear mother-in-law was not very kind to me--but Ifeel it to be a very solemn day. And you may be very witty and veryclever, though you don’t show it to me--but I won’t have laughing andnonsense at my table on poor dear Lady Piercey’s funeral day.”What was Margaret to do? She could not defend herself from so grotesquean accusation. She looked up with some quick words on her lips, but didnot say them. It was intolerable, but it was at the same time ludicrous;a ridiculous jest, and yet the most horribly, absurdly seriouscatastrophe in the world.“The laughing seems all on your husband’s side,” said Colonel Piercey,unable to refrain.“Oh!” said Patty, fixing upon him a broad stare: and then she, too,permitted herself a little laugh. “It’s the strangest thing,” she said,“and I can’t help seeing it’s ridiculous--though laughing is not in mymind, however it may be in other people’s, on such a day--here’s agentleman sitting at my table, and everybody knows him but me.”“I don’t know him,” cried Gervase, “not from Adam; unless it’s GeraldPiercey, the soldier fellow that mother was so full of before I went offto get married: though nobody knew I was going to get married,” he said,with a chuckle, “except little Osy, that gave me---- I say, where’slittle Osy, Meg?”“I hope,” said Patty severely, “that children are not in the habit ofbeing brought down here after dinner as they are in some places. It’ssuch bad style, and, I’m thankful to say, it’s going out of fashion.It’s a thing as I could not put up with here.”“Send some one upstairs,” said Margaret, in a low voice to the footmanwho was standing by her, “to say that Master Osy is not to come down.”“What are you saying to the servant? I don’t want to be disagreeable,”said Patty, “but I object to a servant being sent away from hisbusiness. Oh, if the child comes usually, let him come, but it must befor the last time.”“If I may go myself,” said Margaret, half rising, “that will be the mostexpeditious way.”“Not before you have finished your dinner,” cried Patty; “oh, don’t,pray. I should be quite distressed if you didn’t have your dinner. Andyou had no tea. I know some ladies have trays sent upstairs. But I can’ttolerate such a habit as having trays upstairs: so for goodness’ sake,Margaret Osborne, sit still and finish your dinner here.”Colonel Piercey moved his chair a little; he managed to look beyond thebouquet at Margaret, sitting flushed and indignant, yet incapable ofcompleting the absurdity of the situation by a scene at table before theservants. Colonel Piercey had run through all the gamut of astonishment,anger, and confusion; he had arrived at pure amusement now. Themomentary interchange of glances made the situation possible, and it wasimmediately and unexpectedly ameliorated by the melodramatic appearanceof Dunning behind in the half-darkness at the door.“Mr. Gervase, if you please, Sir Giles is calling for you,” the mansaid.Patty sprang up from her seat. “Sir Giles? the dear old gentleman! Oh, Iforesaw this! He is ill, he is ill! Come, Gervase!” she cried.“Not a bit,” said Gervase; “it’s only Dunning’s way. He likes to stopyou in the middle of your dinner. There’s nothing the matter with thegovernor, Dunning, eh?”“There’s just this, that he’s a-calling for Mr. Gervase, and not noother person,” Dunning said, with slow precision.“Well, I’m Mrs. Gervase; I’m the same as Mr. Gervase. Come, come, don’tlet’s lose a moment! Moments are precious!” cried Patty, rushing to herhusband and snatching him out of his chair, “in his state of health andat his age.”Margaret and the Colonel were left alone, but the fear of the servantswas upon them. They did not venture to say anything to each other. Theywere helped solemnly to the dish which had begun to go round, and for amoment sat in silence like two mutes, with the inexorable bouquetbetween them. Then Colonel Piercey said, in very bad French, “This isworse than I feared. What are we to do?”“I shall go to my room to Osy before she comes back.”“I have no Osy to go to,” he said with a short laugh. “What a strangescene! stranger than any in a book. I am glad to have seen it once in away.”“Not glad, I hope,” said Margaret. “Sorry for Uncle Giles and all therest. But she is not so bad as that. No, no, she is not. You don’tsee--she wants to assert all her rights, to show you and me how strongshe is, and how she scorns us. On ordinary occasions she is not likethis.”“You are either absurdly charitable in your thoughts, or else you wantto throw dust in my eyes, Cousin Meg.”“Nothing of the kind; I do neither. It is quite true. She is not bad incharacter at all. She will be kind to Uncle Giles, and probably improvehis condition. We have all had a blind confidence in Dunning, andperhaps he doesn’t deserve it. She wants to get Uncle Giles into herown hands, and she will do so. But he will not suffer; I am sure of it.”“Poor old gentleman! It is hard to be old, to be handed from one toanother. And will he accept it?” Colonel Piercey said.“She will be very nice and kind, and she is young and pretty.”“Oh, not--not that!”“You are prejudiced, Cousin Gerald. She is pretty when you see her inher proper aspect, and there can be no doubt she is young. Her voice isnice and soft. It is almost like a lady’s voice. Hush! I think I hearher coming back!” Margaret rose hurriedly. “Please say to Mrs. Piercey,Robert, that I am tired, and have gone to my room.”“Let me come too,” said Gerald Piercey, following her into the hall. “Ishall go away to-morrow, of course--and you, what are you going to do?”“I cannot go to-morrow. I shall have to wait--until I am turned out, ortill I can go.”“I wish you would come with me to my father’s, where you would be mostwelcome: and he is a nearer relative than I am.”“Thank you; you go too far,” said Margaret. “To think me a schemingwoman only this morning, and at night to offer me a new home, where Imight scheme and plot at my leisure? No, I will do that no more: I willgo to nobody. We are not destitute.”“Meg! will you remember that you have nobody nearer to you than myfather and me?”“But I have,” she said, “on my mother’s side, and on my husband’s side.We shall find relations wherever we go.”He answered by an impatient exclamation. “There is one thing, at least,on which we made a bargain a few hours since,” he said.The lamp in the hall did not give a good light. It was one of the thingswhich Patty changed in the first week of her residence at Greyshott. Itthrew a very faint illumination on Margaret Osborne’s face. And she didnot say anything to make her meaning clear. She did nothing but hold outher hand.Patty, meanwhile, had made her way, pushing her husband before her, toSir Giles’ door. She pushed him inside with an earnest whisper. “Go in,and talk to him nicely. Be very nice to him, as nice as ever you can be.Mind, I’m listening to you, and presently I’ll come in, too.”The room was closely shut up, though it was a warm night, and scarcelydark as yet, and Sir Giles sat in his chair with a tray upon the tablebeside him. But he had pushed away his soup. His large old face wasexcited and feverish, his hands performing a kind of tattoo upon hischair. “Are you there, my boy? are you there, Gervase?” he said. “Comein, come in and talk to me a little. I’m left all alone. I have nobodywith me but servants. Where’s--where’s all the family? Your poormother’s gone, I know, and we’ll never see her any more. But where’severybody? Where’s--where’s everybody?” the old gentleman said with hisunsteady voice.“I’m here, father, all right,” Gervase said.“Sir Giles, sir, he’s fretting for company, and his game, and all that;but he ain’t fit for it, Mr. Gervase, he ain’t fit for it. He have gonethrough a deal to-day.”“I’ll play your game, father. I’m here all right,” Gervase repeated.“Come, get out the table, you old humbug, and we’ll throw the men andthe dice about. I’m ready, father; I’m always ready,” he said.“No, no,” said Sir Giles, pushing the table away; “I don’t want anygame. I’m a sad, lonely old man, and I want somebody to talk to.Gervase, sit down there and talk to me. Where have you been all thislong time, and your mother, your poor mother, wanting you? What have youbeen doing? You can go, Dunning; I don’t want you now. I want to talk tomy boy. Gervase, what have you been doing, and why didn’t you comehome?”“I’ve been--getting married, father,” said Gervase, grinning from ear toear. “I would have told you, but she wouldn’t let me tell you. Shethought you might have put a stop to it. A fellow wants to be married,father, when he’s my age.”“And who has married you?” said the father, going on beating with histremulous fingers as though keeping time to some music. “Who has marriedyou, my poor boy? It can’t be any great match, but we couldn’t expectany great match. I saw--a young woman: I thought she was--that I hadsomehow seen her before.”“Well, she’s--why, she’s just married to me, father. She’s awful proudof her new name. She signed her letter--for I saw it--Mrs. GervasePiercey, as if she hadn’t got any other name.”“She shouldn’t do that, though,” said the old man, “she’s Mrs. Piercey,being the son’s wife, the next heir. If Gerald had a wife, now, she’d beMrs. Gerald, but not yours. I’m afraid she can’t know much about it.Gervase, your poor mother was struck very suddenly. She always fearedyou were going to do something like that, and she had somebody in hermind, but she was never able to tell me who it was. Gervase, I hope itis somebody decent you have married, now your poor mother isn’t here.”“Oh, yes, father; awfully decent,” said Gervase, with his great laugh.“She would have given it to any one that wasn’t civil. She was one thatkept you on and kept you off, and as clever as Old Boots himself, and upto----”Patty had listened to this discussion till her patience was quite wornout. She had waited for a favourable moment to introduce herself, butshe could not stand and hear this description, so far beneath her meritsas she felt it to be. She came in with a little rush of her skirts, notdisagreeable to the old man, who looked up vaguely expectant, to see hersweep round the corner of the large screen that shielded him from thedraught. “I must come and tell you myself who I am, Sir Giles,” shesaid. “I’m Patience; and though, perhaps, I shouldn’t say it, I’m onethat will take care of _that_, and take care of the house, and see thatyou are not put upon by your servants, nor made to wait for anything,but have whatever you wish. And I’ll be a very good daughter to you, ifyou’ll let me, Sir Giles,” she said.The old gentleman had passed a miserable week. First his wife’s illness,so dreadful and beyond all human commiseration, and then her death, andthe gloom of the house, and the excitement of the funeral, and theneglect of everything that made life bearable to him. It is true, thathis soup and his wine and whatever food was allowed to him were suppliedregularly, and no actual breach of his comforts had occurred. But hisroom had been darkened, and his backgammon had been stopped, and therehad been no cheerful faces round him. Even little Osy’s company had beentaken away. The child had been stated to be “too much” for him. Parsonsand Dunning had held him in their hands and administered him, and theywere both determined that he should do and say nothing that was notappropriate to his bereaved condition. The old man was not insensible tohis wife’s death. It brought into his mind that sense of utterdesolation, that chill sensation of an approaching end, which is, alas!not more palatable in many cases to an old man than to a young one. AndParsons and Dunning both thought it the most appropriate thing for himto sit alone and think of his latter end. But Sir Giles was not of thatopinion. His old life was strong in him, though it was hampered with somany troubles. He wanted, rather, to forget that death was waiting forhim, too, round the next corner. Who could tell how far off that nextcorner might be? He wanted to forget, not to be shut up helplessly withthat thought alone. And Mrs. Osborne, with all the prejudices and bondsof the household upon her, had not had courage to break through thelines which had been formed around her uncle. She had believed, as itwas the law of the family to believe, that Sir Giles’ faithful attendantknew best. And thus it was, that when the young woman who was Gervase’swife came boldly in--a young person who was not afraid of Dunning, astranger bringing a little novelty, a little stir of somethingunaccustomed into his life--he looked up with a kind of light in hisdull eye, and relief in his mind. “Oh! you are Patience, are you?” hesaid. “Patience! it is a queer sort of a name, and I think I remember tohave heard it before.”Oh, poor Miss Hewitt, in her red and yellow bonnet! If she had but knownthat this faint deposit of recollection was all that remained in her oldlover’s mind!“But I should like you to call me Patty, Sir Giles.” She went down onher knees at his feet, while the old gentleman looked on in wonder, notknowing what was going to happen. “You have not got that bandage quitestraight,” she said, “and I’m sure you’re not so comfortable as youought to be. I can put it on better than that. Look you here, Gervase,hold the candle, and in a minute I’ll settle it all right.”Sir Giles was so much taken by surprise that he made no opposition; andhe was amused and pleased by her silent movements, her soft touch andmanipulation. The novelty pleased him, and the young head bent over hissuffering foot, the pretty hair, the pleasant shape, were all much moregratifying than Dunning. He thought he was relieved, whether he wasreally so or not. And he was contented, and the spell of the gloom wasbroken. “But I’m not to be settled so easy as my foot,” he said. “Howdared you to take and marry my boy here, Mrs. Patty, or whatever yourname is, without saying a word to me?”Mrs. Gervase Piercey, or Mrs. Piercey, as she henceforward calledherself, walked that night into the great state-room in Greyshott--whereSally Fletcher awaited her, trembling, bringing Patty Hewitt’s smallwardrobe roughly packed in one small box--with the air of a conqueror,victorious along all the line.CHAPTER XXIX.Colonel Piercey left Greyshott the next morning after these incidents.There was no reason why he should stay. Even old Sir Giles had changedhis note when his kinsman took leave of him. Mental trouble does notkeep its hold long on a mind which has grown weak with bodily diseaseand much nursing, that prevailing invalidism and necessity for takingcare of one’s self which absorbs every thought; and though the oldgentleman was still ready enough to mourn for the loss of his life-longcompanion, yet he was easily soothed and diverted by the needs of thatolder companion still, himself. Besides, now that the funeral was over,there was no alarming prospect before him, no terror of being compelledto act for himself. He took leave of the Colonel not uncheerfully.“Going?” he said, when Gerald appeared in his room to say good-bye. “I’mglad you could stay so long; but it’s been a sad visit. Another time,now there’s young people in the house, they’ll make it more cheerful foryou, eh? Don’t be long of coming again.”Colonel Piercey, somewhat stiffly--which was his nature, for he had notthe understanding of human weakness which brings indulgence, and hecould not forget that a few days before the old man had begged him withtears to stay--answered that he was glad to leave his uncle so muchbetter and more satisfied about his son.“Oh,” said Sir Giles, “about satisfied I don’t know, I don’t know; Ican’t tell you at this moment, Gerald. She speaks fair, but then she’son her promotion, don’t you see? Anyhow, she’s young, and perhaps she’lllearn; and she’s nice-looking--and speaks not so badly for a girlwithout education; not so badly, does she, Gerald? We’ll do; oh, I thinkwe’ll do. She’ll look after Gervase, and keep him off me. And that’s agreat thing, don’t you see? Though when I think what his mother wouldhave said--Lord bless me, I tremble when I think what his mother wouldhave said. She never would have borne it. She would have turned thehouse upside down and made everybody miserable; which makes me feel thatbeing as it had to be, it’s perhaps better--better, Gerald, though it’sa hard thing to say, that his mother went first, went without knowing.You will say she suspected; and I believe she did suspect; she was apenetrating woman; but suspecting’s not so bad as knowing; and I’m--I’malmost glad, poor soul, that she’s gone. She would never have put upwith it. And now this one may make something of Gervase--who knows? Itis a kind of anxiety off my mind. Time for your train?” the oldgentleman added cheerfully. “Well, thank you for your visit, my boy;I’ve enjoyed it--and come again, come soon again.”Sir Giles was as much delighted to be free of his visitor as he had beento welcome him to Greyshott. And it was evident that he was conforminghis mind to the new state of affairs. Gerald had meant to appeal to hiskindness for Margaret, but he had not patience or self-command enough tosay anything. He had no thought of the anxieties that dwelt in the oldman’s mind--the dreariness of his conclusion that it was better his oldwife was gone: the forlorn endurance of a state of affairs which he hadno power to prevent. A little more sympathy might have made Sir Giles’endurance take a tragic aspect, the last refuge of a sanguine and simplespirit trying to be content with the hope that something might still bemade of his only child. But Gerald Piercey only thought with mingledcontempt and pity of the facile mind, and the drivel of old age, thingsentirely beyond his sympathy or thoughts.He had an interview of a more interesting kind with Margaret before hewent away. “I wish you could leave as easily as I do,” he said.“So do I--but that would be impossible in any case. I have Osy to thinkof. I must not allow myself to be carried away by any suddenimpulse--even if it were for nothing else, for my poor old uncle’s sake.He is fond of Osy. It might chill his poor old clouded life still moreto miss the child.”“Oh, Uncle Giles! I think you may make your mind easy on that point.It’s age, I suppose, and illness. One thing is just as good as anotherto him.”“I am not quite of your opinion,” she said.“I think you are never quite of any one’s opinion except your own,” heretorted, quickly.“Well, that’s best for me, don’t you think?” she replied, with somethingof the same flash of spirit, “seeing that I have, as people say, nobodyto think of but myself.”“And the boy? Meg, you have promised me that you will think of what Isaid about the boy. He should want for nothing. He should have all theadvantages education could give, if you would trust him to me--or to myfather, if that would give you more confidence.”“It is not confidence that is wanting,” she said.“Then, what is it? It cannot be that you think I speak without warrant.My father will write to you. I will pledge myself to you--as if he weremy very own. His future should be my care; his education, his outset inthe world----”Margaret stood looking at him for some time in silence, a faint smileabout her lips, which began to quiver, the colour forsaking her cheeks.What she said was so perfectly irrelevant, so idiotic, to thestraight-forward mind of the man who was offering her the mostunquestionable advantage, and asking nothing but a direct answer--yes,or no--that he could almost have struck her in his impatience. He didmetaphorically, with the severity of that flash in his eyes.    “And how there looked him in the face      An angel, beautiful and bright;    And how he knew it was a fiend,      That miserable knight.”--This was what Margaret said.“What do you mean?” he cried; “is it I that am the fiend, offering thebest I can think of?”“Oh, the angel,” said Margaret; “and is it my own heart that is thefiend, that makes the other picture? Oh, God help me! I don’t know. Mychild is my life. But there are things better than life, and that mightbe given up. Yet, he is my duty, too, and not yours, Gerald. Prosperityand comfort, and your great warm-hearted, honourable kindness; orpoverty and nature, and a poor mother--and love? Which would be the bestfor him? We cannot see a step before us; and the issues are of life anddeath.”“It is better not to exaggerate,” he said, with an almost angryimpatience. “There need be no cutting off. You should, of course, seethe child when you liked, for his holidays and that sort of thing.There’s no question of life or death, but of a man’s career for the boy,under men’s influence, or---- I know, I know! You would teach himeverything that is good, and put the best principles into him, andsacrifice yourself, and all that. In short, you would make a perfectwoman of him, had Osy been a girl; but, as he is a boy----!”“Don’t you think you’re a little sharp, Gerald,” she cried, “bidding mecut out my heart and give it you, and showing me all the advantages!”She laughed, with her lips quivering, holding her hands clasped,fiercely determined, whatever she did, not to cry, which is a woman’sweakness.“Meg, you are a sensible woman: not a girl, to know no better.”This was his honest thought: a girl, young and tender, is to be spared,though her youth has the elasticity of a flower, and springs up againto-morrow; but the woman who has passed that chapter, whose firstsusceptibilities are over, is a different matter. He was honestlybewildered when Margaret left him hurriedly with a choked “Thank you.Good-bye. I shall write”; and thus broke off the conversation, leavinghim there astonished in the hall, with his coat over his arm, and histravelling bag in his hand: for this was how they had held their lastconsultation, the library and dining-room being both full of Patty,whose presence seemed to occupy the whole house, and who now came forth,with all the airs of the mistress of the house, to take leave of herguest.“Well, Colonel Piercey, so you are going? I hope it is not because ofthe circumstances, though, of course, with a death and a marriage bothin the house, it isn’t very suitable for strangers, is it? But I’m notone that would ever wish to be rude to my husband’s friends. I’m toldyou were going, anyhow, and I hope that’s the case. And I’m sure youmust feel I’m very thoughtful,” said Patty, with a little laugh, “neverto disturb you in your tender good-byes! Oh, I can sympathise with thatsort of thing! I told Gervase, ‘Don’t disturb those poor things; thereisn’t a place where they can have a word quiet before they part.’ But Ihope you’ll soon come and fetch her, Colonel Piercey. You and her, youare not like Gervase and me: you haven’t any time to lose.”“I have not the honour of understanding you, Mrs. Piercey,” said theColonel, very stiffly. “I must leave with you my farewells to my cousinGervase.”“Oh, you needn’t; he’s here, he’s coming--he wouldn’t be so wanting asnot to see you off himself, though you’re only a third or fourth cousin,I hear. But as for not understanding me, Colonel Piercey, I hope youunderstand Meg Osborne, which is more to the purpose, and that you’venamed the day. Marriage is catching, I’ve always heard, and you ain’tgoing to treat a relation badly, I hope, in my house. I’m sure, afterall the philandering and talking in corners, and----”“I wish you good-day, Mrs. Piercey,” the Colonel said. He jumped intothe dog-cart with an energy which even the quiet fat horse of Greyshotttraining could scarcely withstand, and, seizing the reins from thegroom’s hands, drove that comfortable animal down the avenue at a paceto which it was entirely unaccustomed. To describe the ferment of mindinto which he was thrown by Patty’s last words would be impossible. Heheard the loud, vacant laugh of Gervase, and a cry of “Hi! Hallo! Whereare you off to?” sounding after him, but took no notice. He was a man ofconsiderable temper, as has not been concealed, and there could be nodoubt that it would have afforded him considerable satisfaction to takePatty by the arms and shake her, had that been a possible way ofexpressing his sentiments. He was furious, first, he said to himself, atthe insult to Meg; but it is doubtful whether this really was so muchthe cause of his indignation as he believed. The causes werecomplicated, but chiefly had reference to himself, who was moreinteresting to him at present than Meg or any one else in the world.That he should be accused of philandering and talking in corners, or oftreating a woman “badly,” even by the most vulgar voice in the world,had something so exasperatingly inappropriate and unlikely in it that hesaid to himself it was laughable. Laughable, and nothing else! Yet hedid not laugh; he felt himself possessed by the most furious gravityinstead--ready to kill anybody who should so much as smile.Philandering--and with a middle-aged woman! This, no doubt, gave it adouble sting. It had never occurred to Colonel Piercey, though he wasforty, to think of himself as on an elderly level, or to imagine anyconnection of his name with that of any woman who was not young andfair, and in the first chapter of life. I have always been of opinionthat men and women about the same age, when that age has passed theboundaries of youth, are each other’s natural enemies rather thanfriends. They have fully learned that they are on opposite sides. Thereis a natural hostility between them. If some chance has not made themfriends, and inclined to forget or pardon the difference of theirsides, they are instinctively in opposition. To marry each other is thelast thing that would occur to them. Of course, I am considering naturaltendencies only, and not those of the fortune-hunter of either sex, orpersons in quest of an establishment. The man of forty seeks a youngbride; the woman of that age, or near it, finds devotion in a young man.(I don’t say seeks it--for all women feel this question of age to befantastically important.) Gerald Piercey had reached the Greyshottstation, and flung himself and his bags and wraps into a carriage,before he had begun to get over the sting of the suggestion that he hadbeen philandering (Heavens, what a word!), and that not with a girl--animputation which he might have smiled at and pardoned--but with a widow,a mother, a middle-aged woman! Indignity could not go further. Thelittle barmaid, the wretched little tavern flirt who had seizedpossession of the home of the Pierceys, had caught him full in thecentre of his shield.It was not till long after, when that heat had died away, that herecurred to what he had at first tried to persuade himself was theoccasion of his wrath--the insult to Meg. Poor Meg! whose growing old hehad himself so deeply and absurdly resented, as if it had been her ownfault--how would she fare, left in the power of that little demon? Shecould not go off at a moment’s notice, as he could. She would have towait, he remembered with a horrified realisation, perhaps for herquarter-day, for the payment of her pension, before she would be ableto budge at all. And, then, where would she go?--a woman who had beenaccustomed to Greyshott, which, though it was not very luxurious orrefined, was still, in its way, a great house. Where would she go, withher hundred or two hundred, or some such nominal sum, a year? And,perhaps, not money enough in the meantime even to pay her journey, evento carry her away! She was a hot-headed, self-willed, argumentativewoman; determined in her own opinions, caring not a straw for otherpeople’s; refusing, in the most unaccountable way, an advantageoussuggestion--a proposal that would have left her free, withoutencumbrance, to get as much comfort as possible for herself out of hervery small income; an entirely impracticable, unmanageable woman! butyet--to think of that little barmaid flouting her, insulting her, wastoo much for the Colonel. His wrath rose again, not so hot, but full ofindignation--a creature not worthy to tie her shoe! He seemed to see herstanding there, against the dark panelling of the wall, in her blackdress. And, somehow, it occurred to him all at once that the slim, tallfigure did not present the usual signs which distinguish middle age. Howold was Meg Piercey, after all? A dozen years ago, when he had been atGreyshott last, she was a girl in her teens. Twelve years do not make agirl of nineteen middle-aged. She had married at four orfive-and-twenty--not earlier; and Osy was seven or thereabouts. Geraldfound himself unconsciously calculating like an old woman. If she hadmarried at twenty-four, and if Osy were seven, that did not make hermore than two-and-thirty at the outside. At thirty-two one is notmiddle-aged; the Colonel did not feel himself so at forty. To be sure, awoman is different; but even for a woman, though it may not be soromantic as eighteen, it is not a great age--thirty-two. And to beturned out of her home; and to be left with next to nothing to live on;and to be insulted by that vulgar little village girl; and to be setdown, even by a man, a relation, one bound to make the best of her, asalmost an old woman--at thirty-two! Poor Meg Piercey! Poor MargaretOsborne! The home of her childhood gone, and the protection of hermarried life gone. And her child! What was the difficulty about herchild? Something more, perhaps, when one came to think of it, thanmerely being left without encumbrance, freed from responsibility! Whenone came to think of it, and to think how other women were, with theirchildren about them, perhaps, after all, it meant more than that. PoorMeg! poor Meg!CHAPTER XXX.Mrs. Osborne realised very fully all the weight of the trouble which hadfallen upon her, but it is to be doubted whether she would have likedthat compassionate apostrophe to “poor Meg!” any more than other thingswhich had fallen from Gerald Piercey’s lips; or, indeed, whether shefelt herself so much to be pitied as he did. Nobody knows like ourselveshow hard and how heavy our troubles are; and yet, at the same time, ourown case is generally less miserable to us than it is to the benevolentonlooker. The moment it becomes our own case it somehow becomes natural,and finds alleviations, or, if not alleviations, circumstances whichprove it to be no such extraordinary thing. We change our positionaccording to our lot, and even in the self-consciousness of crime becomeimmediately aware of a whole world of people who are as badly off, orperhaps worse, than we are, without the same explanations of theirconduct which exist in our case. Margaret, seeing what had befallen her,and what was about to befall her, instinctively changed her own point ofview, and felt, along with the necessity, a new rising of life andcourage. The long consideration of what she was to do, though perhaps apainful and discouraging deliberation, yet roused all her faculties andoccupied her mind. At thirty-two (since we have arrived through GeraldPiercey’s calculations at something like her exact age), the thought ofa new beginning can never be wholly painful. None of the possibilitiesof life are exhausted; the world is still before us where to choose.Nevertheless it was a confusing and not encouraging subject of thought.Margaret’s education, such as it was, had been completed before any newviews about the education of women were prevalent; indeed, it would nothave mattered much whether these ideas had been prevalent or not, forcertainly it never would have entered into the minds of Sir Giles orLady Piercey to send their niece to Girton, or even to any humbler placepreparatory to Girton. They gave Margaret as little education as wasindispensable, entertained reluctantly a governess for her for someyears, and had her taught to play the piano a little, and to draw alittle, and to have an awkward, not speaking acquaintance with theFrench verbs, which was all they knew or thought of as needful. Whatcould she do with that amount of knowledge, even now, when she hadsupplemented it with a great deal of reading, and much thinking of herown? Nothing. No school would have her as a teacher, no sensible parentwould trust her, all unaware of the technique of teaching as she was,with the education of their children. And what was there else that awoman, a lady, with all her wits about her, and the use of all herfaculties, could do? That was the dreadful question. Margaret did notfall back with indignation on the thought that its chief difficultyarose from the fact that she was a woman; for she knew enough of life tobe aware that a man of her own class in the same position, trained tonothing in particular, would be almost as badly off. There were“appointments” to be had, she knew, for men certainly, for woman too,occasionally, but she was perfectly vague about them, what they were.And the idea of going out to an office daily, which was her soleconception, and on the whole a just one, of what an “appointment” mightmean, filled Margaret with a bewildering sense of inappropriateness andimpossibility. It would not be she who could fill any such place.It would be something different from herself, a shadow oroutward appearance of her, impossible for herself to realise.Impossible--impossible! She knew nothing but how to read, to think, todischarge the duties of a mother to her child, to live as English ladieslive, concerned with small domestic offices, keeping life more or lessin harmony, giving orders to the servants, and smoothing over thetempests and troubles which arose from the imperfect execution of theseorders--and looking after the poor. To do all these things is to be anot unimportant servant to the commonwealth. Life would go far moreroughly, with less advantage on both sides, were it not forfunctionaries of this kind: but then their services are generally to behad for nothing, and are not worth money; besides--which makes thematter more difficult still--these services lose a great part of theirreal value when they are done, not for love but for money, in which casethe house lady of nature changes her place altogether and goes over toanother and far less pleasing kind.These thoughts had passed through Margaret’s mind vaguely, and withoutany pressure of an immediate emergency, many times already in the courseof her speculations as to the future for Osy and for herself. She hadoften said to herself that she could not remain at Greyshott for ever;that the time must come when she would have to decide upon something;that the old couple who were her protectors could not live for ever; andthat the house of Gervase, poor Gervase, however it might turn out,would probably be no home for her. She had gone over all thosesuggestions of what she could do to increase her small income, and toeducate her child, with a ceaseless interest, but yet without anysharpness or urgency, as of a thing that might happen at any moment. Andthere was always a vague ground of probability behind--that either oneor other of the old people, who were so fond of Osy, might leave himsomething to make his first steps easier, that they would not go out ofthe world without making some provision even for herself, who had servedthem like their own child, and knew no home but under their wing. Therewould be that, whatever it was, to make everything more possible. Shehad not calculated on it, and yet she had felt assured that some suchthing would be. But now all those prospects had come to an end in amoment. Lady Piercey had left no will at all, and Sir Giles was nolonger a free agent, or would not be so any longer. The prospect was cutoff before her eyes, all that shadowy margin gone, nothing left but thebare certainty. Two hundred a year! There are very different ways oflooking at two hundred pounds a year. It is not very long since thepapers were full of letters demonstrating the impossibility ofsupporting life with honesty and gentility on seven hundred a year. Thecalculations looked so very convincing, that one rubbed one’s bewilderedeyes if one had been accustomed to believe (as I confess I had) thatthere was a great deal of pleasant spending for two young people inseven hundred a year. On the other hand, I have just read a novel, and avery clever novel, in which it is considered quite justifiable for ayoung man to marry and take upon him the charge of his wife’s mother andsister on a hundred and fifty pounds a year. Clearly there is a verygreat difference between these estimates, and I think it very likelythat the author of the latter is more practically instructed as to whatshe is speaking of than the gentleman who made the other calculations.Who shall decide upon the fact that lies between these two statements? Ican only say that Margaret Osborne’s conclusion was not to waste hertime in efforts to get work which she probably could not do well, andwhich would be quite inappropriate to her, but to try what could be doneupon her two hundred pounds a year. Ah! how many, many millions ofpeople would be thankful to have two hundred a year! How many honest,good, well-conditioned families, “buirdly chiels and clever hizzies,”have been brought up on the half of it! But yet there are differenceswhich cannot be ignored. The working man has many advantages over thegentleman, with his host of artificial wants--but, alas! we cannot goback easily to the rule of nature. Margaret was not so utterlyunprovided for as her cousin Gerald had remorsefully imagined. She wasnot destitute, as she said. She had laid a little money aside for thisalways-threatening emergency; and she had spoken to Sarah, Osy’s maid,who, though reluctantly and on a very distant and far-off possibility,had declared it possible that she might undertake to do the work of asmall house. “But, oh! I wouldn’t, ma’am,” Sarah had said, “not if I wasyou; you would miss Greyshott and the nice big rooms, and nothing to dobut ring the bell.” Margaret had laughed at this conception of life, andlaughed now as she recalled it. But no doubt it was true. She was notvery apt at ringing of bells, nor did she require much personalservice--still it would not be without a regret, a sense of thedifference--but that was of too little real importance to be thought ofnow.Indeed, all these thoughts were as nothing to the other which GeraldPiercey, in his desire to help her, had flung into her mind like anarrow of fire. To carry Osy away to that cottage, to deprive him of allthose “advantages” which, even at his age, a child can understand--Osywould know very well what that sacrifice meant when he had no pony toride on, no great rooms to run about in, no obsequious court offlatterers ready to carry him on their shoulders, to give him drives andrides on nobler animals, to bring him dainties, and all kinds ofindulgences. Osy had been the favourite of the house, as well as of oldSir Giles and my lady. He had been as free of the housekeeper’s room asof the library. There was nobody who had not bowed down before him andsought to please him. The child, though he was only a child, wouldunderstand what it was to relinquish all these, to have a small cottage,a little garden, nothing outside of them, and only a mother within. Atseven years old to have this brought home to him, was early, very early.He would not understand how it was. If he heard, even at that early age,that he might have had another pony, another household to conquer by hispretty ways, and all the usual indulgences and pleasant things, but forhis mother, would Osy’s childish affection bear that test? Would he likeher better than his pony? And, oh! still deeper, more penetratingquestion, was she better than the pony, better than the largerupbringing, the position of one who is born to command, the freedom oflife, the influence of men, the “every advantage” of which GeraldPiercey had spoken? Would she, a woman not very cheerful, and who mustin future be very full of cares and calculations how to make both endsmeet, would she be better for him than all that? She? What questioncould be more penetrating? “It would be better for the child.” Would itbe better for him? Sometimes it comes about that in the very midst ofthe happiness of life, with every sail full, and the sun shining, andthe horizon clear, there comes a sudden catastrophe, and some youngwoman whose life has been that of the group of children at her knee, hassuddenly to stop and stand by with dumb anguish, and see one and anothertaken away from her by kind friends, kindest friends! benefactors onlyto be blessed and praised! while all around her other friendscongratulate her, bid her feel that she must not stand in the way of thechildren, of their real advantage! Is it to their real advantage? Is itbetter to be the children of kindness or the children of love? to bebrought up in your own home or in another’s? Oh, poor little mother;often you have to smile out of your broken heart and bear it! MargaretOsborne had but one thing in the world; but she would have done like theothers, and smiled and endured even to be severed from that onlypossession, had she been sure. Who can be sure? She said to herself thatlove, and his own home, and the ties of nature were best. And thenGerald Piercey’s words came back and stung her like fiery serpents: “Aman’s career, under men’s influence, or----” Or what? A poor woman’sinfluence, a woman who was herself a failure, whom nobody cared much forunder the sun. Which--which would be the best for Osy? This is the kindof argument that tears the heart in two. It is full of anguish while itis going on: and after the decision is made, it lays up poignant anddreadful recollections. If I had not done that, but the other--if I hadnot sent away my child into the careless hands of strangers; or, on theother hand, if I had not been so confident of myself; if I could buthave seen how much better for him would have been the man’s influence,the man’s career!This was the war that Margaret was waging with herself while she had tomeet the immediate troubles of the day. It was inconceivable how soonthe great house was filled with Patty’s presence, how soon it becamehers, from roof to basement, how she pervaded it in all the rooms atonce, so to speak, so that nothing was out of her sharp sight for morethan two minutes. Mrs. Osborne had retired upstairs with her heart fullwhen she left Colonel Piercey in the hall; but in the restlessness of adisturbed mind she came down again about an hour afterwards, partly toput a stop, for a time, to that endless argument, partly to write aletter which she had promised, to inform Lady Hartmore of what hadhappened, and partly, perhaps, out of that curiosity and painfulinclination to hasten a catastrophe which comes to the mind in thestorms of existence. It is true that she had made up her mind to leaveGreyshott, but she could not do so as Gerald, a visitor, did, nor wasshe sure how she could best arrange her retirement with dignity andcomposure. She felt that there must be no semblance of a quarrel, norwould she make matters worse for Gervase’s wife by allowing it to appearto the county that her first act had been to drive Gervase’s cousin outof the house. She had decided to wait a little, to endure the new_régime_ until she could quietly detach herself without any shock to herold uncle or commotion in the house. Yet it cannot be denied thatMargaret’s nerves were very much disturbed, and that she was consciousof Patty’s entrance while she sat writing her letter, and felt her heartjump when that active, bustling little step became again and againaudible. Margaret was seated with her back to the door, but the sound ofthis step, returning and returning, betrayed to her very clearly theimpatience with which her presence was regarded. And her letter did notmake much progress. She foresaw the coming attack, and she did notforestall it as she might have done by going away. At last a voice assharp as the step broke the listening silence of the room.“Margaret Osborne! how long are you going to be writing that letter? Thehousemaids are waiting, and I must have this room thoroughly done out.It wants it, I am sure! Oh, take your time! but if you will let me knowabout when you are likely to be done----”“I can finish my letter upstairs, if it is necessary,” Margaret said,turning round.“Well, I think generally that is the best way. The library’s generallysupposed to be the gentlemen’s room in a house. I mean to have thedrawing-room put in order, and to use that, as it ought to be used. Butnot just this week, and poor mother so lately buried. I don’t know whatyour feelings may be, but I can’t sit in a dingy place like this,” Pattysaid. “Oh, take your time,” she added, with fine irony; “but if youcould tell me within half an hour or so when you are likely to havedone----”“I will finish my letter in my own room.”“If I was you,” said Patty, “I’d write them all there in future. Newfolks make new ways. I am very particular about my house. I likeeverything kept in its proper place--and every person,” she addedsignificantly. “The servants can’t serve two masters. That is in theBible, you know, so it must be true.”“I do not think,” said Margaret, with a faint smile, “that you will betroubled by their devotion to me.”“No; I suppose you have let yourself be put upon,” said Patty; “because,though you think yourself one of the family, you ain’t exactly one ofthe family, and, of course, they see that. It’s not good for a housefulof servants to have a sort of a lady, neither one thing nor another,neither a mistress nor a servant, in the house. It teaches them to bedisrespectful to their betters, because they know you can’t do anythingto them. I would rather pension poor relations off than have them aboutthe house putting everything out.”“It will not be necessary in my case,” cried Margaret, with a suddenflame of anger and shame enveloping her all over. “I had fully intendedto leave Greyshott, but wished to avoid any appearance of---- any shockto my uncle.”“Oh, take your time!” cried Patty, with a toss of her head; and shecalled to the housemaids, who appeared timorous and undecided at thedoor. “Come here, and I’ll show how I wish you to settle all this infuture,” she said. “Oh, Mrs. Osborne’s going! You needn’t mind forher.”CHAPTER XXXI.It was not worth while to be angry. She had known, of course, all along,how it must be. There had been no thought in her mind of resistance, ofremaining in Greyshott as Patty’s companion, of appealing to her uncleagainst the new mistress of the house. It had not been a very happy homefor Margaret at any time; though, while Lady Piercey lived, it was asure one, as well as habitual,--the only place that seemed natural toher, and to which she belonged. Perhaps, she said to herself, as shewent hurriedly upstairs, with that sense of the intolerable which alittle insult brings almost more keenly than a great sorrow, it wasbetter that the knot should thus be cut for her by an alert and decisivehand, and no uncertainty left on the subject. She went into her roomquickly, with a “wind in her going,” a sweep of her skirts, an actionand movement about her which was unlike her usual composure. Sarah wasalone in her room, not seated quietly at work as was her wont, butstanding at the window looking out upon some scene below. There was acorner of the stable yard visible from one window of Margaret’s rooms,which were far from being the best rooms in the house.“Where is Master Osy?” Mrs. Osborne said.“He is with Sir Giles, ma’am. I--I was just taking a glance from thewindow before I began my work----”“Sarah,” said Margaret, “we shall have to begin our packing immediately.We are going away.” How difficult it was not to say a little more--notto relieve the burden of her indignation with a word or two! for,indeed, there was nobody whom she could speak to except this round-facedgirl, who looked up half frightened, half sympathetic, into her face.“Oh, ma’am, to leave Greyshott! Where are you a-going to?” Sarah said;and her open mouth and eyes repeated with dismay the same question,fixed upon Margaret’s face.“Shall you be so sorry to leave Greyshott?” said Mrs. Osborne.Sarah hung her head. She took her handkerchief from her pocket, andtwisted it into a knot; finally the quick-coming tears rolled over herround cheeks. “Oh, ma’am!” she cried, and could say no more. Anurserymaid’s tears do not seem a very tragic addition to any trouble,and yet they came upon Margaret with all the force of a new misfortune.“What is it, Sarah? Is it leaving Jim? is that why you cry?”“Oh, we was to be married at Christmas,” the girl cried, in a passion oftears.“Then you meant to leave me, Sarah? Why didn’t you tell me so? Well, ofcourse, I should not hinder your marriage, my good girl; but Christmasis six months off, and you will stay with Master Osy, won’t you, tillthat time comes?”Sarah became inarticulate with crying, but shook her head, though shecould not speak.“No!--do you mean no? I thought you were fond of us,” said poorMargaret, quite broken down by this unexpected desertion. It was of noimportance, no importance! she said to herself; but, nevertheless, itgave her a sting.“Oh, don’t ask me, ma’am, don’t ask me! So I am, fond: there never was anicer lady. But how do I know as Jim---- they changes so, they changesso, does men!” Sarah cried, among her tears.“Well, well; you will pack for me, at least,” said Margaret, with afaint laugh, “if that is how we are to part, Sarah,--but you must beginat once; no more looking out of the window, for a little while, atleast. But Jim is a good fellow. He will be faithful--till Christmas.”She laughed again; was it as the usual alternative to crying? or was itbecause there are junctures of utter forlornness and solitude to which alaugh responds better than any crying? not less sadly, one may be sure.Sarah dried her streaming eyes, but continued to shake her head. “It’sout o’ sight out of mind with most of ’em,” she said. “I’ll have to goand get the boxes, ma’am, and I don’t know who there is to fetch ’emup, unless I might call Jim--and the others, they don’t like to see agroom a-coming into the house.”“Then let the others do it, Sarah.”“Oh, Mrs. Osborne! they won’t go agin the---- the new lady, as theycalls her. Oh, they calls her just Patty and nasty names amongthemselves, but if you asks them to do a thing, they says, ‘We wasn’thired to work for the likes of you and your Missus, Sal.’ Not a betterword from one o’ them men,” cried Sarah, “not one of ’em! They’re asfrightened of her already as if she was the devil, and she isn’t farshort. I’ll call him, ma’am, when they’re at their dinners; and,perhaps, you’d give him a word, just a word, to say as how you thinkhe’s a lucky fellow to have got me, and that kind of thing--as a truefriend.”“Is that the office of a true friend?” said Margaret. It is a greatthing in this life, which has so many hard passages, when you are ableto be amused. Sarah’s petition and the words which she kindly put intoher mistress’s mouth, did Margaret more good than a great deal ofphilosophy. She went away after a time to look for her boy and to tellher uncle of the decision she had come to. They were out, as usual, inthe avenue, Sir Giles being wheeled along by a very glum Dunning, andOsy babbling and making his little excursions round and about the oldgentleman’s chair.“When I am a man,” Osy was saying, “I s’all be far, far away from here.I s’all be a soldier leading my tompany. I s’an’t do what nobody tellsme--not you, Uncle Giles, nor Movver, nobody but the Queen.”“And I sha’n’t be here at all, Osy,” said the old man. “When you comeback a great Captain like your cousin Gerald, there will be no old UncleGiles to tell you what you said when you were a little boy.”“Why?” said the child, coming up close to the chair. “Will they put youdown in the black hole with Aunt Piercey, Uncle Giles?”“Master Osy, don’t you speak of no such drefful things,” said Dunning.“But Parsons said, ‘She have don to heaven,’” said the child. “I likeParsons’ way the best, for heaven’s a beau’ful place. I’d like to go andsee you there, Uncle Giles. You wouldn’t want Dunning, you’d have anangel to dwive you about.”“Oh, my little man!” said Sir Giles, “I don’t think I am worthy of anangel. I’m more frightened for the angel than for the black hole, Osy. Idon’t think I want any better angel than you are, my nice little boy. Ihope God will let me go on a little just quietly with Dunning, and youto talk to your old uncle. Tell me a little more about what you will dowhen you are a man. That amuses me most.”“Uncle Giles, Cousin Gervase doesn’t do very much though he’s a man.He’s only don and dot marrwed. I’m glad he’s dot marrwed. I dave him mybig silver penny for a marrwage present. If he hadn’t been marrwed hewould have tooked it, and a gemplemans s’ouldn’t never do that. So I’mglad. Are you glad, Uncle Giles?”“Never mind, never mind, my boy. Are you sure you’ll go to India, Osy,and fight all the Queen’s battles? She doesn’t know what a great, grandchampion she’s going to have, like Goliath,” said the old man with hisrumbling laugh.“Goliaf,” said Osy, gravely, “wasn’t a nice soldier. He was more big noranybody and he bragged of it. It’s grander to be the littlest and win. Iam not very big, Uncle Giles, not at pwesent.”“No, Osy. That’s true, my dear,” said the old gentleman.“But I’ll twy!” cried the boy. “I’m not fwightened of big men. They’regenerwally,” he added, half apologetically and with a struggle over theword, “nice to little boys. Cousin Colonel, he is wather like Goliaf. Hedave me a wide upon his s’oulder; but when he sawed Movver tomin, he----Are big men ever fwightened of ladies, Uncle Giles?”“Sometimes, Osy,” said Sir Giles, with a delighted laugh.“Then it was that!” cried Osy. “I touldn’t understand. Oh, wait, UncleGiles; just wait till I tatch that butterfly. I’ll tatch him; I’ll tatchhim in a moment! I’m a great one,” the child sang, running off--“fortatching butterflies, for tatching---- Movver, movver, you sended itaway.”“What did the little shaver mean by giving a wedding present?” said SirGiles. “Where’s my money, Dunning? have I got any money? If he gave myboy a wedding present, it was the--the only one. They’ll come in now,perhaps, when it gets known; but I’ll not forget Osy for that, I’ll notforget Osy for that. Did you ever see a child like him, Dunning? I neversaw a child like him, except our first one that we lost,” said the oldman with a sob. “Did I ever tell you of our first that we lost? Justsuch a child; just such a child! And my poor Gervase was the dearestlittle thing when he was a baby, before----. Children are very differentfrom men--very different, very different, Dunning. You never know howthe most promising is to grow up. Sometimes they’re a---- a greatdisappointment. They’re always a disappointment, I should say from whatI’ve seen, comparing the little thing with the big man, as Osy says.But, please God, we’ll make a man of that boy, whatever happens. Ah,Meg! is it you? I was just saying we must make a man of Osy--we mustmake a man of him--whatever happens.”“I hope he will turn out a good man, Uncle Giles.”“Oh, we shall make a man of him, Meg! not but what, as I was saying,they’re always disappointments more or less. Your poor aunt would neverlet me say that, when she was breaking her poor heart for our first boythat we lost. I used to say he might have grown up to rend ourhearts--but she would never hear me, never let me speak. It broke herheart, that baby’s going, Meg.” This had happened a quarter of a centurybefore, but the old gentleman spoke as if it had been yesterday. “Youmay think she did not show it, and looked as if she had forgotten; butshe never forgot. I saw it in her eyes when she saw Gerald Pierceyfirst. She gave me a look as if to say, this might be him coming home, adistinguished man. For he was a delightful child--he might have grown tobe anything, that boy!”“Dear Uncle Giles! You must try to look to the future--to think thatthere may be perhaps other children to love.” Margaret laid her handtenderly upon the old man’s shoulder, which was heaving with thoseharmless sobs--which meant so little, and yet were so pitiful to thebeholder. “I wanted to speak to you--about Osy, Uncle Giles.”“Yes, yes,” said the old man, cheering up. “Did you hear that he gave mypoor Gervase a wedding present? that little chap! and the only one--theonly one! I’ll never forget that, Meg, if I should live to be a hundred.And, please God, we’ll pay it back to him, and make a man of him, Meg.”“It was precisely of that, Uncle, I wanted to speak.” But how was she tospeak? What was she to say to this old man so full of affection and ofgenerous purpose? Margaret went on patting the old gentleman on theshoulder unconsciously, soothing him as if he had been a child. “DearUncle Giles, you know that now Gervase is married, they--he will want tolive, perhaps, rather a different way.”“What different way?” said Sir Giles, aroused and holding up his head.“I mean, they are young people, you know, and will want to, perhaps--seemore company, have visitors, enjoy their life.”Sir Giles gave her an anxious, deprecating look.“Do you think then, Meg, that--that she will do? that she will know howto manage? that she will be able to keep Gervase up to the mark?”“I think,” said Margaret, pausing to find the best words, “I think--thatshe is really clever, and very, very quick, and will adapt herself andlearn, and--yes--I believe she will keep him up to the mark.”“God bless you for saying so, my dear! that is what I began to hope. Wecould not have expected him to make a great match, Meg.”“No, Uncle.”“His poor mother, you know, always had hopes. She thought some nice girlmight have taken a fancy to him. But it was not to be expected, Meg.”“No, Uncle. I don’t think it was to be expected.”“In that case,” said Sir Giles--he was so much aroused and interestedthat there was a certain clearness in his thoughts--“in that case, it isperhaps the best thing that could have happened after all.”“Dear Uncle, yes, perhaps. But to give them every chance, to make themfeel quite at ease and unhampered, I think they should be left tothemselves.”“I will not interfere with them,” he cried; “I will not meddle betweenthem. Once I have accepted a thing, Meg, I accept it fully. You mightknow me enough for that.”“I never doubted you, Uncle; but there is more: I think, dear UncleGiles, I must go away.”“You--go away!” he said, looking up at her, his loose lips beginning toquiver; “you--go away! Why, Meg, you can be of more use here than ever.You can show her how to--how to--why, bless us, we all know, after all,that though she’s Mrs. Piercey, she was only, only--well, nobody, Meg!you know--don’t bother me with names. She is nobody. She can’t know howto--to behave herself even. I looked to you to---- Dunning, be off withyou: look after Master Osy. I know it’s wrong to speak before servants,Meg, but Dunning’s not exactly a servant, he knows everything; he hasheard everything discussed.”“Too much, I fear,” said Margaret half to herself. “Dear Uncle, perhapsyou have not considered that mine has always been rather a doubtfulposition. I am your niece, and you have always been like my father, butGervase’s wife thinks me only a dependant. One can’t wonder atit--neither mistress nor servant. She thinks a little as the servantsdo. I am only here as a dependant. She will not take a hint from me. Shewill be better without me here. For one thing, she would think I waswatching her, and making unkind remarks, however innocent I might be. Itis best, indeed it is best, dear Uncle, that I should go.”“Go! away from Greyshott, Meg!--why, why! Greyshott--you have alwaysbeen at Greyshott.”“Yes, Uncle Giles, thanks to you; dear Uncle Giles, when I was anorphan, and had no one, you have done everything for me; but now thebest thing I can do for you is to go away. Oh, I know it, and am sure ofit; everything will go better without me. You may imagine I don’t liketo think that, but it is true.”There was an interval, during which the old man was quite broken down,and Dunning, rushing to his master’s side, shot reproachful speeches, aswell as glances, at Mrs. Osborne. “It appears,” said Dunning, “that I’mnever believed to know nothink, not even my own dooty to my master; butthose as comes to him with disagreeable stories and complaints, and thatjust at this critical moment in the middle of his trouble, poorgentleman, knows less than me. Come, Sir Giles. Compose yourself, SirGiles. I’ll have to give you some of your drops, and you know as youdon’t like ’em, if you don’t take things more easy, Sir Giles.”“I’m better,” said the old gentleman, feebly; “better, better. But, Meg,you’ve got no money--how are you to live without money, Meg?”“I have my pension, uncle.”“A pension! what is a pension? It isn’t enough for anything. Even yourpoor aunt always allowed that.”“It is enough to live on, Uncle--for Osy and me.”“Osy, too,” he cried--“Osy, that I was just saying we must make a manof! You are very, very hard upon me, Meg. I never thought you would behard upon me.” But already Sir Giles was wearied of his emotions, andwas calming down.“I hope there will be other children to make up to you, Uncle Giles.”“What!” cried the old man, “is there a prospect of that? Are therethoughts of that already, Meg? Now, that is news, that is news! Now youmake up for everything. Whew!” Sir Giles uttered a feeble whistle, andthen he gave a feeble cheer. “Hurrah--then there may be an heir to theold house still. Hurrah! Hurrah?”“Shall I say it for you, Uncle Giles?” said Osy. “Stand out of the way,Movver, and let Uncle Giles and me do it. Hurrah!” cried the littlefellow, waving his hat upon Sir Giles’ stick. “Now, Uncle Giles, hip,hip, as the men do--hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!”CHAPTER XXXII.This was about Osy’s last performance in the house which was the onlyhome he had ever known. He did not know what he was cheering for, butonly that it was delightful to make a noise, and that his old uncle’stremulous bass, soon lost in an access of sobs and laughter, was veryfunny. Osy would willingly have gone on for half an hour with this novelamusement; but it must be allowed that when he found the great boxesstanding about in the room that had been his nursery, and began to watchthe mysteries of the packing, his healthy little soul was disturbed byno trouble of parting, but jumped forward to the intoxicating thought ofa journey and a new place with eager satisfaction and wonder. Everythingwas good to Osy, whether it was doing exactly the same thing to-day ashe had done every day since he was born, or playing with something thathe had never done or known before. He was much more perplexed to be keptupstairs after dinner, and not allowed to go down to the library, thanhe was by the removal from everything he had ever known. And when nextmorning he was driven away in the big carriage to the railway station,he was as ready to cheer for the delight of the outset as he had been,without knowing why, for Uncle Giles’ mysterious burst ofself-gratulation. All things were joyful to the little new soul settingout upon the world.Patty, however, was by no means delighted with Margaret’s promptwithdrawal. She felt herself forestalled, which was painful, and thepower of the initiative taken from her. She had intended to play for alittle, as the cat plays with the mouse, with this fine lady, who hadonce been so far above Patty Hewitt, and to whom, in her schoolgirldays, she had been expected to curtsey as to the Queen. Patty’s hearthad swelled with the thought of bringing down pride (a moral process, aseverybody knows), and teaching the woman who had no money, and thereforeno right to set herself up above others, her proper place; and it vexedher that this fine _rôle_ should be taken from her.“Oh, you are going, are you?” she said. “I hope it isn’t on my account.When I married Gervase I knew all that there was to put up with, andmore than has turned out. I knew I shouldn’t have my house to myself,like most new married ladies, and I had made up my mind to all that. Iwouldn’t have turned you out, not for the world--however you might havebeen in my way.”“I am afraid I have a strong objection,” said Margaret, “to be inanybody’s way.”“Ah, that’s your pride,” said Patty, “which I must say I wonder at in aperson of your age, and that knows she has nothing to keep it up on.You’ve got a pension, haven’t you, that’s enough to live on? It’s a finething having money out of all our pockets to spend as you please; but Inever heard that a pension was much to trust to, and if you were tomarry again you would lose it all. And your boy to bring up, too. Myfather-in-law has a tremendous idea of your boy. I think it’s good forhim, in one way, that you are taking him away; for it’s ridiculous tobring up a poor child like that, who hasn’t a penny, to think that he’sas good as the heir, and treated by everybody as if he was really agentleman’s son, you know, with a good fortune at his back.”Margaret smothered with difficulty the indignation that rose to herlips, but she said quietly, “You must disabuse your mind of any suchidea. Osy never could be my uncle’s heir. The heir of Greyshott afterGervase--and, of course, Gervase’s children--is not Osy, but GeraldPiercey, our cousin who has just gone away.”Though this was precious information to Patty, she received it with atoss of her head.“I hope,” she said, “I know a little about the family I’ve married into;but I can tell you something more, and that is, that it’ll never be yourfine Colonel’s, for all so grand as he thinks himself; for it’s all infather-in-law’s power, and rather than let him have it he’ll leave itall away. I wouldn’t see a penny go to that man that gives himself suchairs, not if I were to make the will myself to take it away.”“I hope,” said Margaret, with an effort, “that there will be naturalheirs, and that there need be no question on that point.”“Oh, you will stand up for him, of course!” cried Patty; “but I’d likeyou to know, if you’re making up the match on that score, that it’llnever come to pass. Me and Gervase is both against him, andfather-in-law won’t go against us both, not when he gets used to me. I’drather see it all go to an ’ospital than to that man. I can’t bear thatman, looking down upon those that are better than himself, as if he wason stilts!” Patty grew red and hot in her indignation. Then she shookout her dress airily, as if shaking away the subject and theobjectionable person. “Oh yes,” she said, “natural heirs!” with aconscious giggle. “It’s you that has gone and put that infather-in-law’s old head. But I told him it was early days. Dear oldman. It’s a pity he is silly. I don’t think he ever can have been muchin his head, any more than----. Do you?”“My uncle is in very bad health. He is ill, and his nerves are muchaffected. But he has always been a man quite--quite able to manage hisown affairs. A man,” cried Margaret, faltering a little with indignationand distress, “of very good sense and energy, not at all like--not atall----”“Well, well,” said Patty, “time shows everything, you know, and he’squite safe with me and Gervase; at all events, whatever comes after, hisonly son comes first, don’t he? And me and Gervase will see that thedear old man isn’t made a cat’s-paw of, but kept quite square.”It was with a sensation half of disappointment, yet more than half ofsatisfaction, that Patty found herself next morning alone in what shecalled so confidently her own house. Alone, for Sir Giles, of course,was in his own room, and was much better there, she felt, and Gervase,so long as he was kept in good humour, was not very troublesome. To besure, it cost a good deal of exertion on her part to keep him in goodhumour. He felt, as so many a wooer of his simple mind has done, thewant of the employment of courtship, which had so long amused andoccupied him. He could no longer go to the Seven Thorns in the evening,a resource which was entirely cut off from his vacant life, from thefact of having Patty always with him, without the exercise of anyendeavour on his own part. The excitement of keeping free of hismother’s scrutiny; the still greater excitement of fishing furtively forPatty’s attention, making her see that he was there, persuading her byall the simple wiles of which he was master to grant him an interview;the alarm of getting home, with all the devices which had to bepractised in order to get in safely, without being called to account andmade to say where he had been--and inspected, to see what he had beendoing: all this took a great deal of the salt out of poor Gervase’slife. He did not know, now that he had settled down again at home, andall the annoying sensations of the crises were over, what to do withhimself in the evenings. Patty and he alone were rather less livelythan it had used to be when Sir Giles and Lady Piercey sat in theirgreat chairs, and the game of backgammon was going on, and Meg about,and the child rampaging in all the corners. Even to have so many morepeople in the room gave it to him an air of additional animation. Pattytold him it was the library that looked so dull. “Such a room for youall to sit in,” she said, “so gloomy and dark, with these horrid oldpictures, and miles of books. Wait till I have the drawing-room inorder.” But it didn’t amuse Gervase to watch all the alterations Mrs.Patty was making, nor how she was having the white and gold of the greatdrawing-room furbished up. The first night they sat in that huge room,with all the lamps lit, and the two figures lost among all the gildingand the damask, and reflected over and over again, till they were tiredof seeing themselves in the big mirrors, Gervase felt more lonely thanever. Never had Patty found so hard a task before her,--not when she hadto attend to all the customers alone, and keep their accounts separatein her head, and to chalk up as much as was safe to the score of onetoper, and cleverly avoid hearing the call of another who had exceededthe utmost range of possible solvability. Never, when she had all thatto do, had she found it so heavy upon her as it was to amuse Gervase.She invented noisy games for him, she plied him with caresses when othermethods failed, she endeavoured to revive the old teasings and elusionsof the courtship; but as Gervase’s imagination had never had much to dowith his love-making, these attempts to return to an earlier stage weregenerally futile. He could not be played with--made miserable by afrown, brought back again by a smile, as had once been the case. AndPatty had more than the labours of a Hercules in keeping her Softy inorder. There was no one to defend him from now, no tyrannical mother tobe defied, to make him feel the force of the wife’s protection. When SirGiles was well enough to come to the drawing-room after dinner, the taskwas quite beyond the powers of any woman; for it was needful to pleasethe old gentleman, to give up everything for him, to represent to himthat his company was always a delight to his children. Poor old SirGiles had winked and blinked in the many lights of the greatdrawing-room. He had been dazzled, but he had not been ill-pleased.“We never used this, you know, in your mother’s time but for company,”he said. It was Gervase whom he seemed to address, but it was Patty whoreplied.“I thought it would be a little change for you,” she said. “A change isalways good, and there’s more light and more air. You should always haveplenty of air, and not the associations that are in the other room.”“Perhaps you are right, my dear,” the old gentleman said with a sigh. Itwas she who was “my dear” now; and, indeed, she was very attentive toSir Giles, never neglecting him, doing everything she could think of forhis pleasure. It was on one of the evenings when she was devotingherself to him, playing the game he loved, and allowing him to win inthe cleverest way, that Gervase, who was strolling about the room withhis hands in his pockets, half jealous of his father, calling her, nowin whispers, now loudly, to leave that and come to him, at lastdisappeared before the game was finished. Patty went on hurriedly withthe backgammon, but she was on thorns all the while. She had establishedthe habit of sending off Dunning, whom she was slowly undermining, lessfor any serious reason than because he was a relic of the past _régime_;and, therefore, she was now helpless; could not leave Sir Giles; couldnot interrupt the process of amusing and entertaining him. Where had theSofty gone? to prowl about the house looking for something that mightamuse him; to fling himself dissatisfied upon his bed and fall asleep inthe utter vacancy of his soul? An uneasy sense that something worse thanthis was possible oppressed Patty as she sat and played out the game ofbackgammon. Then there ensued another dreadful interval, during whichSir Giles talked and wondered what had become of his son. “He has goneto sleep somewhere, I shouldn’t wonder,” said Patty; “the nights aregrowing long, and poor dear Gervase wants a little amusement. I wasthinking of suggesting, dear papa (this was the name she had fixed uponSir Giles, who had resisted at first, then laughed, and finally acceptedthe title with the obedience of habit), that we should both play, he andI, against you. You are worth more than the two of us, you know.”“Nonsense, you little flatterer. You’ve a very pretty notion of thegame. I had to fight for it that last round. I had, indeed. I had tofight for my life.”“Ah, dear papa!” said Patty, shaking her head at him. “You are worth farmore than the two of us! but it would keep us all together, all thefamily together.”“I don’t like Gervase to play with me,” said Sir Giles fretfully. “He’stoo noisy, and he has no sense; he can’t understand a refined game. Ishouldn’t wonder if he had gone out to some of his old haunts that hispoor mother couldn’t bear. The Seven----. I beg your pardon, my dear, Iam sure,” the old gentleman cried, colouring up to his eyes.“Dear papa, why should you beg my pardon? But oh, no! Gervase has notgone to the Seven Thorns. He went there for me. That makes all thedifference. Why should he go back now?”“My dear,” said Sir Giles again, “I must beg your pardon. I didn’tintend to make any insinuation. Of course it was for you. But it’s adangerous thing to acquire a habit, especially for one that--for onethat doesn’t, don’t you know, take in many ideas at a time.”“I know him better than that. I know where he is, the lazy boy. But,dear papa, fancy, it is ten o’clock; your bedtime. Oh, how soon tencomes when we have a pleasant game, and in such good company! I supposeI must ring for Dunning now.”“Yes, you had better ring for Dunning. If I am a little bit late, andshould have a headache or anything, he throws it in my teeth. We havehad a very pleasant game, and I must say that for you, my dear, that youknow how to make the time pass. Well, Dunning, here I am, ready you see,ready to the minute, thanks to Mrs. Gervase, who is a great deal morecareful of me than you are, you surly old beggar. Good night, my dear;but tell Gervase from me that it isn’t good manners to break up theparty; but he never was renowned for good manners, poor boy,” the oldgentleman said, shaking his head as he was wheeled away.And then Patty had a bitter moment. She went to the library, where hesometimes took refuge, falling asleep upon the old sofa, where he hadlain and kicked his heels as a child; and then to his room, where hesometimes went when he was dull, to throw himself upon his bed. ButGervase was not to be found in either place. He came stumbling to theold door which opened on the yew avenue, late at night, and she herselfran downstairs to admit him--angry, yet subduing herself. He had resumedhis old habit, as his father had guessed: the habit which had beenformed for Patty, and which she had so sharply shaken him out of with apower and mastery which she no longer possessed. Patty felt in thatmoment the first drawback of that unexampled elevation which she hadattained with such unexpected ease. Had she married in her own class,the publican’s daughter would not have been very deeply wounded by herhusband’s return on an occasion in such a plight. But when she stoledown through the sleeping house and admitted the future master ofGreyshott, and led him upstairs, hushing his broken speech and stumblinggait, that nobody might hear, Patty learned something which no othermanner of instruction could have conveyed to her. She found that therewere things that were harder upon a lady (such as she flattered herselfshe had become) than on a village woman. She coaxed and soothed him tobed, like a nurse with a child, that nobody should suspect what hadhappened; and she ground her teeth and vowed vengeance upon her father,who had dared to take the Softy in and treat him like this. And thusthere arose before Patty a prospect which appalled even her brisk andcourageous spirit. What if she should not be able to put this downsummarily and with the strong hand? Then what would become of her hopesof winning a place in the county, and being acknowledged by all thegreat people as worthy to make her entrance among them? After the firstunexpected triumph of becoming mistress of a great house and a number ofservants, her ambition had risen to higher flights; and this was whatthat over-vaulting ambition aimed at. But what would become of thathope, or of many others, if the Softy, startled out of himself for amoment by his marriage, should fall back into the beerhouse societywhich suited him best? Patty fell from the height of her dreams when shesaw that sight which is always a pitiful one for a young wife. She feltthe burden of “the honour unto which she was not born” come down for thefirst time with a crushing weight upon her. Oh, it was not so simpleafter all--so easy, so pleasant to be a lady! She had begun already toforget that it was to Gervase she owed her advancement, and to feel theburden of keeping him amused and employed. Now she felt that the Softyhad it in his power to mar that advancement still. She had cleared everyhostile influence out of the house; she had got rid of every rival. Shehad conquered Sir Giles, and gained possession of the keys, and becomethe acknowledged mistress of Greyshott. What a great thing, what awonderful thing, for Patty Hewitt! And yet she felt, in the bitternessof her heart, that it might be better to be still Patty Hewitt, with allthe world before her, than to be Mrs. Piercey, of Greyshott, with thatSofty to drag her down.This was the first big thorn that pierced Patty’s foot, and reminded herthat she was mortal, as she was marching on in her victorious way.CHAPTER XXXIII.Patty had been triumphantly successful in the first chapter of hercareer. She had an easy victory over her father-in-law. She had clearedthe house of everybody whom she disliked or feared. First, Mrs. Osborne,and with her--not least in Patty’s estimation--Sarah, Osy’s maid, whohad been at school with her, and whom she was still more anxious to getrid of than her mistress. Then Parsons, who knew a great deal too muchof the family to be endurable for a moment; then the one servant in thehouse who had ventured to be rude to Gervase’s wife, John the footman: adreadful example, whose sudden fate had exercised the most salutaryinfluence over the rest of the household. It is true that Dunning stillremained Sir Giles’ attendant, against whom there were the sameobjections as against Parsons; but for the moment, at least, Dunning wasindispensable, and had to be borne with. She stood, however, after thefirst month of her sway on the very top-gallant of success, supreme inthe house, her word a law, the oldest and most secure arrangementsfalling to pieces at her will, the entire order of affairs changed toplease her. Everything had gone as she desired, and no head had beenlifted up in rebellion. The great wardrobes were full of fine clothes.She had shuffled off Miss Fletcher, the village dressmaker, and procuredthe finest and most highly cultivated maid that ever advertised in the_Times_. Lady Piercey’s stores of lace and linen, and even herold-fashioned jewellery, which was much more valuable than beautiful,were in Patty’s hands. She had realised all her dreams, and more thanall. But there is nothing perfect in human affairs, and now the reverseof her good fortune began to rise out of the mists before Patty’s eyes.The first trouble of all was, perhaps, the cutting off of her connectionwith her home and origin. Her father had come to see her very early inher story, had been received in the half-dismantled library for a shortangry conference, and left with a crimson countenance and a volley ofmuttered oaths, and had never come again. But there was another memberof the family who was less easy to get rid of. Miss Hewitt made a callin state, in her most splendid costume, with a bonnet still moreexuberant in red and yellow than that in which she had witnessed thefuneral of Lady Piercey. She descended upon Patty at an early hour, whenMrs. Gervase was still profoundly occupied with the restoration of thegreat drawing-room, and made her way there, regardless of the oppositionof the polite butler. “Perhaps you are not aware that I am Mrs.Piercey’s own aunt,” that lady said fiercely; “I shall go to my niecewherever she is. I have no fear of not being welcome.” The butler knew,also, too well who the visitor was, and he trembled for the consequencesof his weakness as she pushed her way before him into the room where thecarpenter and his apprentice and a couple of housemaids were executingPatty’s orders, under her close superintendence. The men were on ladderscleaning the long mirrors, the maids were busy with the furniture, whilePatty, seated in a gilt and brocaded chair sat in state looking on.“Place that table in the corner, there, and these two chairs beside it.Not that, you stupid; the deep gentleman’s chair on one side, and thisone without arms on the other--let me see. Yes, that will do, with apalm or a great fern behind.” Patty held her head on one side tocontemplate the effect, while the two housemaids stood looking on, notyet so much accustomed to the new sway that they did not exchange aglance, a “la! much she knows about it,” when her attention was calledaway.It was, indeed, with no small start and sensation that Patty’s attentionwas called away. She was sitting thus, with her head on one side,contemplating the group of furniture, perhaps imagining herself in thechair without arms, with a silken train arranged about her feet (whenher mourning should be over, for Patty was, in all things, a sticklerfor propriety), while some grand gentleman, a viscount at least, leantover the table entertaining her from the depths of the “gentleman’schair”: when there suddenly burst upon her consciousness a bustle atthe door, a quick throwing open, and a voice which was harsh andjarring, but alas, how well known and familiar!“Patty, my pet, here I am! That man of yours wanted to put me in awaiting-room, but I said, Where she is there I’ll go; and here I am, mylittle lovey, and a happy woman to see you in your own house.”“Oh!” cried Patty, rising quickly from her chair. Her wits were so muchabout her, even in this great and sudden shock, that she refrained fromsaying aunt in the hearing of that excited audience--which was foolish,indeed, since all the housemaids and all the carpenters in Greyshottparish knew very well that Miss Hewitt, of Rose Cottage, was Mrs.Piercey’s aunt, and far the richest, consequently the most respectableof her kindred. Patty could not say much more, for she was enfolded inthe heavy drapery of Miss Hewitt’s Paisley shawl, and almost stifled inher close embrace. “And bless you, all’s ended as I said it would; andain’t I glad I was the one to help you to it?” Miss Hewitt said in herenthusiasm, bestowing a large audible kiss on Patty’s face.“Oh, dear!” said Patty, as soon as she could speak. “This isn’t theplace to receive any one in. Jervis, why didn’t you show the lady intothe morning-room? I can’t talk to you here, with all the servantsabout.”“Don’t blame the man,” said Miss Hewitt; “I wanted to see you free,without stopping whatever you were doing. It’s not as if I were a merevisitor as couldn’t make allowances. I just like to see everything, andwhat it was like before, and what you’re doing. I know you, Patty. Theywon’t know it for the same ’ouse afore you’re done with it. Well, thisis a nice room! but none too big for what you’ll want when you getthings your own way. Greyshott won’t know itself with all the doingsthere’ll be.”“Oh, but I can’t receive any lady here,” said Patty. “Let me take youinto the morning-room; it’s where I always sit in the morning. Icouldn’t possibly sit and talk with a caller before lunch in any otherplace. If you don’t mind I’ll show you the way.”The butler held the door open with an obsequious air in which there was,as that functionary was well aware, an over-acting of his part--but thatdid not occur to the ladies who swept out, Patty in advance, and to whomit would scarcely have seemed too much if Jervis had walked backwardsbefore them. He stayed behind to make his comment with uplifted handsand eyes upon the spectacle. “Lord, ain’t she a-going it!” said Jervis.It was, perhaps, not dignified for a person in his position to unbosomhimself to the housemaids and the carpenter; but how could mortal mankeep silent in circumstances so exciting? The ladies went to themorning-room in another frame of mind, both of them putting on silentlytheir armour for the inevitable battle. When they had reached the roomwhich was to be the scene of it, Miss Hewitt flung herself at onceheavily into an easy chair. “Well! I call this a poky little place,” shecried. “You might have sent the servants away, Patty. I liked that otherplace much better. Morning-room! why it’s no better than my parlour,”she cried.“It would only hold the whole of your house, kitchen and all,” criedPatty; “and it’s where I choose people to come,” she added decisively,“when they’ve that little sense as to come in the morning, when _no_lady receives.”“Oh, that’s how I am to be met, is it?” said Miss Hewitt, “you littleungrateful wretch! It was nothing but dear aunt, and how good I was,when you came to me to help you. Ah! you had to come to me to help tosecure him at the last--and him nothing but a Softy. If I had hadsomebody to stand for me like I did for you, Miss Patty, Greyshott wouldhave been a very different place, and you’d never have got your nose inhere!”“Well, Aunt,” said Patty, “if those are your ideas, you can’t wonderthat I shouldn’t want you. For if you had married Sir Giles, which Isuppose is what you mean, and would never have let me get my nose in,you’ll understand that I don’t want your nose in. I wouldn’t have saidit so plump if you hadn’t begun. Though I don’t believe Sir Giles everthought of such a thing, now I know him well.”“He’s not a Softy, you see,” said the angry old lady, with a snort.“No,” said Patty, sedately; “he’s not a Softy. I should think he’d had agood deal of common-sense in his day. But I don’t want to quarrel,” sheadded; “whatever you may do. No doubt you’ve come about your money,which is quite natural. You shall have your money, Aunt Patience. Itwasn’t so needful as I thought it would be, for Mr. Piercey had plentyfor what was wanted; but, of course, I’m much obliged to you all thesame.”“Oh, Mr. Piercey: that’s what you call the Softy now!” cried MissHewitt, in high scorn.“It’s what I always called him, and it’s his name and mine too. I’m Mrs.Piercey, as the heir’s wife, and not Mrs. Gervase. My father-in-law saysso, and he ought to know.”“Oh, your father-in-law,” cried Miss Hewitt, with extreme bitterness;“you’ve changed all your relations, I see. When it comes to a person todisown their debts and their folks----”“I do neither the one nor the other,” cried Patty. “You shall have everypenny of your fifty pounds--and interest, if you like, with that. Andeverybody knows my folks,” she cried, with a toss of her head. “Oh, nofear that they’ll ever be forgotten. Father’s been here with the smellof beer about him like to knock you down, and when I told him I couldn’tbear it, what does he do but fling out of the house cursing andswearing, and letting everybody see.”“Well, your father is a trial,” Miss Hewitt allowed candidly. “I don’twonder, Patty, as you were hurt; but so was he, and he won’t come backno more, won’t Richard. You can’t, anyhow, my pet, have the sameobjections to me.”Miss Hewitt held her head aloft, and her golden flowers nodded andrustled. The complacency of her smile, and the confidence that in herthere was nothing to find fault with, was too much even for Patty. Shecould not say the words that came to her lips.“Well, Aunt Patience,” she said, in subdued tones, “I am treating youjust the same as if you were Lady Hartmore.”“And no more than is my due, Patty. I might have been my lady many andmany’s the year if I’d had an Aunt Patience as would have done for me asI’ve done for you. Has she been to call already? She’s one as alwaysrespects the rising sun.”“No,” said Patty, still more subdued, “she has not been yet--but that’seasy explained, where there’s been so lately a death in the house.”“And a good thing for you, too! If ever there was a tyrant of awoman---- But I see you’re in deep crape, Patty, to show your grief.”“I hope I know better than to show any want of respect to mymother-in-law. And I think, Aunt Patience, you might have known betterthan to come to a house that’s in such mourning with all these colourson your head.”“My bonnet!” cried Miss Hewitt. She caught sight of herself in a glass,and bridled and smiled at herself, instinctively arranging the bow ofred ribbon that was tied under her chin. “I never had such a becomingbonnet in my life; and as for mourning, there’s nobody could expect meto put on black for her.”“No,” said Patty, “and that’s why I hadn’t expected even a call fromyou, Aunt Patience, during the mourning--not being in any way a realconnection of the house.”Miss Hewitt fixed her eyes very wide open upon those of her niece, andthe two maintained a silent combat by that method for at least a minute.It was the elder who gave in the first. “If that’s how you’re going totreat your own relations,” she said, “Patty, you’ll not see much of me.And I can tell you, as well as if it had happened already, you won’t seemuch of other folks. There’s none of the grand people as you’re lookingfor that will come near the place. The rector’ll call because he’s boundto, and because you was once his show girl at the Sunday School; and thenew curate will call to see if he can get a subscription for something,but, mark you my words: nobody else--no, not a soul! and when you’vebundled everybody belonging to you out of your doors, then you’ll seewho you’ll have to speak to. I’m sorry for you, Patty, I am indeed.”“Are you, Aunt Patience?” cried Patty, with defiance. “When it comes tothat, I’ll send for you back.”“It’s a deal easier,” said Miss Hewitt sententiously, “to whistle folksaway than to bring them back.”But after this there was a cessation of hostilities, and in the end MissHewitt was taken over the house to see all its splendours, which, asmuch as possible, she depreciated. She was the only witness of herelevation whom Patty had as yet had, and though some sacrifice of prideand spirit was necessary, a natural longing to impress and dazzle herworld, through the means of some spectator, was still stronger. Pattywent so far as to offer her aunt some of those pairs of silk stockingswhich Parsons had been counting when her new mistress fell upon her.“They’re such good stockings,” Patty said, “but miles too big for me.”“If you think I’ll wear her old cast-off things!” cried Miss Hewitt,purple with rage, flinging them back into the drawers from which Pattyhad taken them. “And my foot, if anything, is a little smaller thanyours,” she added, with angry satisfaction. But when the visitorlingered and at last betrayed her desire to be asked to stay for“dinner”--a word which came out unadvisedly, and which she immediatelycorrected, with a blush--“Lunch, I suppose you call it,”--Patty assumedvery high ground.“My dear Aunt! if we were by ourselves of course it would not matter;but dear papa always takes his luncheon along with us.”“And who’s dear papa?” asked Miss Hewitt, with natural derision.“I mean Sir Giles, of course; he’s in very delicate health, and we haveto be very careful.”“Sir Giles,” said Miss Hewitt grimly, “has seen me before.”“Yes--he said so when he heard my name--he said, Where have I heard thatname before?”“Patty, you’re a little devil; he knows a deal more than that of me.”“Ah, well, perhaps once, Aunt; but his memory’s gone now; and to bringin a stranger to the luncheon table! Perhaps you don’t remember,” saidPatty severely, “that my poor dear mother-in-law has not yet been afortnight in her grave.”Miss Hewitt was thus got rid of, though not without trouble; but Pattydid not find it easy to forget what she had said, especially when itcame true to the letter; for week after week went by and not a step,except that of the doctor, crossed the threshold of Greyshott. Pattytook her place in the drawing-room every afternoon, with everythingarranged very cleverly, and looking as like as an imitation could be tothe little _mise en scène_ of a young lady waiting for her guests; butno guests ever came. At length, after much waiting, thereappeared--exactly as Aunt Patience had said--the rector! accompanied byhis young daughter, for he was a widower. The rector called her Patty inthe first moment of meeting, and though he amended that in a confusedmanner, and gave her finally her full honours as Mrs. Piercey, it wasdifficult to get over that beginning, which threw his young companioninto utter discomfiture. And then, to make matters worse, he delivered alittle lecture upon the responsibilities of her new position and thedifficulty of the duties that would come upon her. “You must not letyour mind dwell on your disadvantages,” he said kindly; “everybody,after a while, will make allowances for you.” “You are quite mistaken ifyou think I want to have allowances made for me,” said Patty, provoked.And what could the rector reply? He said, “Oh!” thus showing the povertyof the English language, and how little a man in such a predicament canfind to say for himself; and then he began hurriedly to talk parishtalk, and ask Mrs. Piercey’s patronage for various charities--charitiesby which Patty Hewitt might almost have been in a position to benefit soshort a time ago. “That’s well over,” he said to his daughter, wipinghis forehead, when they went out of the gates of Greyshott. And he didnot come again, nor she--not even the girl. And nobody came; and of allthe difficult things in the world Mrs. Gervase Piercey found nothing sodifficult as to explain to her grand maid how it was that no visitor wasever seen at Greyshott. The thing itself was bad enough, but to explainit to Jerningham was still worse. “You see we are still in deepmourning,” Mrs. Piercey said. “Yes, ma’am,” said Jerningham, with asniff of polite scepticism. For a lady who, however deep her mourningmight be, had not a single friend to come to see her, was more thanJerningham could understand. And Patty sat alone in her finedrawing-room, and walked about her great house, and spoke to nobody butold Sir Giles and her own Softy; and thought many times, with a kind ofalarm, of what Aunt Patience had said. Had it not already come true?CHAPTER XXXIV.This, however, was after all but a small matter; it was not actualmisfortune. Patty, indeed, felt it much, partly on account of Jerninghamand the other servants, who she felt must triumph in thisnon-recognition of her claims; and also a little for herself, for it wasan extraordinary change from the perpetual coming and going of the SevenThorns, and all the admiration and respect which she had there, thejokes, and the laughter and the talk, which if not refined, were goodenough for Patty Hewitt--to the condition of having no one to speak to,not a soul--except old Sir Giles and her own Softy, whose conversationclever Patty could not be said to have enjoyed at any time. It was verydull work going on from day to day with nothing better than poor old SirGiles’ broken talk, which was about himself and his affairs--not abouther, naturally the most interesting subject to Patty. Many times she wastempted to go upstairs and sit with Jerningham to unbosom herself andrelieve her mind of all the unspoken talk, and make a companion and_confidante_ of her maid. Jerningham was a person much better trainedand educated than Patty. She could have instructed her in many of theways of the fine ladies which Mrs. Piercey could only guess at, orpainfully copy out of novels; but perhaps, if her mistress had yieldedto this impulse it would have been Jerningham who would have held back,knowing her place and desiring no confidences. Patty, however, also knewher place, and that to confide in a servant was a fatal thing, so thatshe never yielded to this temptation. But how dull it was! It is a finething to be the mistress of a great house, to have a large householdunder your orders, to be served hand and foot, as Patty herself wouldhave said; but never to have a gossip, never a jest with any one, shefor whom every passer-by had once had a cheerful word, to have nobody toadmire either herself or her dresses, to envy her good fortune, towonder at her grandeur! that takes the glory out of any victory. WouldCæsar have cared to come back with all the joy and splendour of atriumphal procession had there been nobody to look at him? Patty hadsucceeded to the extent of her highest dreams, but, alas! there wasnobody to see.That, however, was merely negative, and there was always the hope thatit might not last. She took her seat in the drawing-room every day withperennial expectation, still believing that somebody must come; and, nodoubt, in the long run, her expectation would have come true. But Pattysoon had actual trouble far more important than any mere deprivation.She had been afraid of Sir Giles, over whom her victory had been easy,and she had been afraid of the servants, whom she had now completelyunder her foot; but she never had any fear about the Softy, her husband,who had been her dog--a slave delighted with his chains--who had desirednothing better than to do what she told him, and to follow her aboutwherever she went. That Gervase should become the only rebel againsther, that he should escape her authority and influence, and take his ownway in opposition to hers, was a thing which had not entered into any ofher calculations--Gervase, whose devotion had been too much, who hadwearied her out with his slavish dependence on her, how had heemancipated himself? It was inconceivable to Patty. She had felt surethat whatever happened she could always control him, always keep him insubjection, guide him with a look, be absolute mistress of his mind andall his wishes. The first revelation of something more in Softy whichshe had not calculated upon had come when she first found the difficultyof amusing him in the long evenings (lit with so many wax candles,surrounded with so many glories!). Then it was revealed to Patty thatshe was not enough even for that fool. Then it began to dawn upon herfaintly that the Seven Thorns itself had something to do with theattraction, and the excitement of the suspense, and the restraint andexpectation in which she had held him: all these adjuncts were over now;he had Patty all his own, and he did not find Patty enough. Was thatpossible? could it be true?Perhaps there was something in the very ease of Patty’s triumph that hadto do with this. Had his mother lived, and had Gervase experienced thatprotection of having a wife to stand by him, which he had anticipated,it is very likely that this result would have been long delayed, if,indeed, it had ever appeared at all. But there was nobody now againstwhom Gervase required to be protected. His father had never opposed him,and now that Sir Giles was, like everybody else in the house, underPatty’s sway, not even the faint excitement of a momentary struggle withhim chequered the Softy’s well-being. The consequence was that he, aswell as Patty, found it dull. He had no one to play with him, he longedfor the movement of the alehouse, the sound of the carts and carriages,the slow jokes in the parlour, the smoke and the fun--also the beer; andperhaps that most of all. It was hard work even when Patty was devotedto his constant amusement, for the Softy had no intervals; he wanted tobe entertained all the time: and when she flagged for a moment, hebecame sullen and tugged at his chain. But when Sir Giles came on thescene, and Patty’s attention was distracted and her cares given to theold man, offence and sullen disgust arose in the mind of Gervase. Hewould not join in the game, as Patty called him to do; neither fathernor son indeed wanted a third in the game: and Gervase, duller than everand angry too, went to sleep for a night or two, tried to amuse himselfanother evening or two with cat’s cradle or the solitaire board--thenflung these expedients aside in impatience, and finally strolled off,through the soft, warm darkness of the night, to the Seven Thorns. TheSeven Thorns! it was poetic justice upon Patty, but that made it onlythe harder to bear.Then there came upon Patty one of those curses of life which fall uponwomen with a bitterness and horror of which probably the inflictors ofthe pain are never fully aware. It would have been bad enough if thishad befallen her in her natural position as the wife of a countrytradesman or small farmer. Domestic misery is the same in one class asin another; yet it would be vain to deny the aggravations that a higherposition adds to primitive anguish of this kind. The cottager is not somuch ashamed of her husband’s backslidings. In many cases they are thesubject of the long monologue of complaint that runs through her life.They cannot be hid, and they become a sort of possession, the readiestexcuse for every failing of her own. But that the young master shouldstumble night after night up to Greyshott; that he should be seen by allthe neighbourhood drinking among the dull rustics at the Seven Thorns;that a crowd of servants should listen and peep to hear his unsteadystep, and his boisterous laugh, and the stammerings of excuse orexplanations, or worse still, of noisy mirth, bursting from him in themiddle of the quiet night--was something more terrible still. Patty--onthat first occasion, when, long after every one else was in bed, shestole downstairs to admit him by that little door near the beech avenue,to which his unsteady footsteps naturally turned--was horrified andangry beyond description; but she did not doubt she could put a stop toit. Not for a moment did she hesitate as to her power. It should neverhappen again, she said to herself. Once was nothing. Henceforward shewould be on her guard. He should not escape from her another time. Shedid not even upbraid Gervase--it was her own fault, who had neverthought of that, taken no precautions; but it should never, never, shesaid to herself, with, perhaps unnecessary asseverations, happen again.Gervase, upbraided as in sport by his laughing wife for forsaking her,as if he had been a naughty child, did nothing but laugh and triumph inreply. “Weren’t they just astonished to see me!” he said: “your fatheropened his mouth like this,” opening his own large mouth with the moisthanging under-lip. “You should ha’ seen him, you should ha’ seen him,Patty--like I was a ghost! ‘Hallo!’ said he, and ‘Hallo!’ said I, ‘hereI am, you see.’ There wasn’t one of them could say a word; butafterwards I stood treat, and we had a jolly night.”“And, oh, how you did smell of beer, you naughty fellow, when you camein!”“Did I? Well, not without reason, neither,” said Gervase, with his loudlaugh; “a set of jolly old cocks when you set them going. We only wantedyou there in your old blue dress and your apron.”“That you will never see again, I can tell you; and it isn’t very niceof you, Gervase, wishing your wife in such a place.”“It’s a good enough place, and it’s where you came from,” said Gervase.“But I told ’em,” he said, nodding his head, “what an awful swell youhave grown--nothing good enough for you. Didn’t the old fellows laughand nod their old heads. Ho, ho! He, he!”“Gervase, dear,” said his wife, “you won’t go there again? you won’t goand leave me all by myself, longing and wondering when you’d come back?I thought you’d gone and fallen asleep somewhere. I thought every minuteyou’d come into the room. You won’t go again, Gervase, dear, and leaveyour poor Patty alone?”“Why, you had father,” Gervase said.“Oh, papa; yes, dear, and I kept on playing to amuse him, dear oldgentleman, and to keep it from him that you had gone out. If he hadknown where you were, it would have vexed him sadly, you know it would.”“It vexed them both,” said Gervase, “when I went there after you; but Ididn’t mind--nor you either, Patty.”“A young single man has to have his liberty,” said Patty, “but when he’smarried---- You wouldn’t have gone off and left me--your Patty, whom yousaid you were so fond of--in those days?”“Ah,” said the Softy, with the wisdom of his kind, “but I’ve got you nowfast, Patty, at home waiting for me; so I can take my pleasure a bit,and have you all the same.” He looked at her with a cynical light inhis dull eyes. He, and she also, felt the strength of the argument. Noneed to please her now, and conciliate her in her own ideas about beerand the parlour of the Seven Thorns. She could no longer cast him off,or leave him in the lurch. Consequently, Gervase felt himself free toindulge his tastes in his own way, whatever Patty might think. She wasstruck silent by that new light in his eyes. He was not capable ofargument, or of anything but sticking to what he had once said, with allthe force of his folly. She looked at him, and, for the first time, sawwhat was before her. It had never occurred to her before that he had thestrength to resist her, or that she could not call him to her like a dogwhen her better sense saw it to be necessary. A docile fool is sometimescontemptible enough; but a fool resistant, a being whom reason cannotteach, who has no power of being convinced! Patty felt a cold dew comeover her forehead. She saw what was before her with momentary giddiness,as if she had looked over the edge of a precipice. But she did not losehope. She sent next day an imperative note to her father requiring hisattendance: that he either should resist or refuse her call did not comeinto her mind. “Come up to Greyshott,” she wrote, “at once, for I havesomething to say to you;” as she might have written to one of herservants. But Richard Hewitt was not a man who could be defied withimpunity. He never appeared in obedience to her summons; he took nonotice of it. He replied only by that silence which is the mostterrible of all kinds of resistance. And it was not long before Gervasedisappeared again. After the second catastrophe, Patty swept down uponthe Seven Thorns in her carriage--an imposing figure in her silk andcrape. But Hewitt was not impressed even by the sight of her grandeur.“I’ll not refuse no customer for you--there! and you needn’t think youcan come over me,” he cried. “By George! to order me about--what I’m todo and whom I’m to have in this house. It’s like your impudence; but Itell you, Miss, I’ll see you d----d first,” the angry man roared,bringing his clenched fist down upon the table, and making all theglasses ring. Patty was cowed, and had not a word to say.And then there began for the triumphant young woman an ordeal enough todaunt the stoutest heart. It was true that she had not, like many a wifein such circumstances, the anguish of love to give a sting toeverything. Patty had used the Softy partly as the instrument of her ownelevation; but his folly had not disgusted or pained her as it mighthave done under other circumstances. She had a sober affection for himeven, as her own property, a thing that belonged to her, and feltstrongly the impulse of protecting him from scandal and injury: more, hewas so involved still in all her hopes of advancement, that she was asmuch alarmed for the betrayal of his bad behaviour, as if (like so many)she had feared the loss of a situation or work which brought in theliving of the family. And it must be added for Patty that she did hervery best to keep all knowledge of Gervase’s conduct from his father.She sat and played his game of backgammon, inventing almost everyevening a new excuse. “Isn’t he a lazy boy? He’s gone to sleep again,”was at first the easiest explanation. But Patty felt that would not doalways. “What do you think, dear papa? Gervase has taken to reading,”she said; “I gave him a nice novel, all hunting and horses, and he gotso interested in it.” “He never was any good outside a horse himself,”Sir Giles said, with a little grumble. But he was easily satisfied. Heasked nothing more than to have his mind relieved from that care forGervase which Lady Piercey had always insisted he should share. “He’sgot his wife to look after him, now,” Sir Giles said, when Dunninghinted a doubt that Mr. Gervase was sometimes out of an evening. He wasthankful to wash his hands of all responsibility. That apparentselfishness of old age, which consists very much of weariness andconscious inability to bear the burden, came over him more and moreevery day. Had such a thing been possible as that Gervase should havemarried a girl in his own position, and made her miserable, the good inSir Giles would have been roused to support and uphold the victim. ButPatty knew very well what she was doing. Patty had accepted all theresponsibilities. She was able to take care of herself. He had his wifeto take care of him, and to keep him off his father. Patty accepted hershare of that tacit bargain honestly; and, as for Sir Giles, it must besaid that he was easily satisfied--received her explanations, and gaveher as little trouble as possible. He nodded his head, and went on withhis game. Perhaps, if truth had been told, it was a relief to the oldman when the Softy--strolling about restlessly from place to place,interfering with the play, calling off his wife’s attention, alwaystroublesome and always ungainly--was not there.CHAPTER XXXV.Patty had been married only about four months, when an incident happenedthat brought this period of humiliation and trouble after her triumph toa climax. The summer had gone, the dark days and long nights of earlywinter had come back, and Gervase’s almost nightly visits to the SevenThorns were complicated by the storms and rains of the season, which,however, were rarely bad enough to keep him indoors. Had Patty been freeto keep a constant watch upon him, it was her opinion that she couldhave prevented his continual escape into the night. She could have madehim so comfortable at home. By moments she had visions of what she coulddo to reclaim her husband and satisfy him, if the dreadful restraint ofthe old man and his nightly game were withdrawn. Once or twice, when SirGiles was indisposed, she had, indeed, managed to do this. She hadbrewed him hot and fragrant drinks to take the place of the beer, andexhausted herself in talk to amuse him. Poor Patty! she thought toherself that surely she must, at least, be as amusing as the old fellowsin the parlour at the Seven Thorns. Many a woman has thought the same:a brilliant young creature, full of knowledge and spirit, and wit andpleasantness, might not she think herself as attractive as the dullgossip of the club? But it is a dangerous conflict to enter into, andthe race is certainly not to the swift nor the battle to the strong inthis respect. And Patty was not an amusing conversationalist. She knewthe methods of rustic flirtation, and how to hold off and call on aprovoked and tantalised lover; and she could be very lively in talkabout herself and what she meant to do; but the first was no longer amethod to be employed with Gervase, who was now brutally conscious ofbeing Patty’s proprietor; and he was not even so much interested in whatshe meant to do as he once had been. He much preferred the heavy jokes,the great guffaw, the half-mocking attention that was paid to himself inthe parlour at the Seven Thorns. He was not in the least aware that thebig laugh that went round, and in which he himself joined with asensation of truly enjoying himself, was chiefly at him and his folly.And his freedom to do what he liked, to drink as much as he liked, andbabble and maunder at his pleasure, was very sweet to Gervase: he likedit better than anything else in the world; perhaps not better than Pattyif there had been a conflict between the two--but then, as he said, hehad Patty all the same whatever he might do, and why shouldn’t he enjoyhimself when it was so entirely in his power?But when Patty sat the whole evening through playing backgammon with SirGiles, her ears on the alert for every sound, her hopes sometimesraised by a footstep on the stairs to imagine that he had not gone outafter all, or her fears excited by some noise to the terror of believingthat he had come back earlier than usual, and was coming in--like thefool he was, to betray himself to his father! it was not wonderful ifshe looked sometimes with a suppressed bitterness at her oldfather-in-law fumbling at his game. What good was his life to that oldman? He could not walk a step without assistance. He was bound to thatchair whatever happened. He had nobody of his own age to speak to, noone except people of another generation, whom he was keeping out of whatPatty called “their own.” “Oh, if the old man were out of the way, howsoon I could put everything right!” Patty said to herself. Though shehad indeed failed, and received a grievous defeat, her confidence inherself was not shaken. It was only circumstances, she thought, thatwere to blame. If she had things in her own hands, if her evenings wereunencumbered, if she could devote herself to her husband as she hadintended to do, let us see how long the Seven Thorns would have stoodagainst her! And, oh, what good was his life to that old man! If he wereto die, what a blessed relief it would be! Full of aches and pains, hisnerves shattered, unable to keep from crying when he talked, unable tothink of anything except his walk (walk! in his chair driven byDunning), and his dinner, which was chiefly slops, and his cups of beeftea, and his drops, and his game at night, which he was allowed to winto please him! Poor Sir Giles! It was not, indeed, a very pleasingprogramme: but it is to be supposed that it did not seem so miserable tohim as to Patty, for Sir Giles showed no inclination whatever to die. Hemight have thought, if he had been an unselfish old man, that he was aburden, that he kept the young people from enjoying their lives, whilegetting so little good out of his own--that if he were but out of theway Patty would be my lady, and free to look after her own husband andkeep him straight; but he did not do so. She sat all the eveningthrough, and said: “Yes, dear papa,” and “How capitally you play!” and“What luck you have!” and “I am nowhere beside you, dear papa,” smilingand beaming upon him, and, to do her justice, exerting all her powers toamuse him; but all the time saying to herself, “Oh, what good is hislife to him! Oh, how can he go on like this, keeping Gervase out of hisright place, and keeping me that I can’t do anything for my own husband!Oh, that we had the house to ourselves and I were free to keep Gervasestraight!”One evening, Patty had been feeling more keenly than usual this keencontrariety and hindrance of everything. Sir Giles had sat longer thanhe generally did, sending off Dunning when he appeared, demanding anhour’s grace and another game. He was in higher spirits than usual.“Come, Patty,” he said, “you’re not tired. Have your revenge and give mea good beating. I’m in high feather to-night. I don’t care that! forDunning. Come back in an hour, and perhaps I’ll go to bed.”“‘Alf an hour, Sir Giles: and that’s too long,” Dunning said.“Half an hour, dear papa--you must not really tempt Providence bystaying any longer,” said Mrs. Gervase. “Have my revenge? Oh, no! butI’ll give you another chance of beating me all to atoms. Isn’t Sir Gileswell to-night, Dunning? He looks ten years younger.”“He’s excited with all that play,” said Dunning. “I don’t ’old with somuch backgammon. If he’s ill in the morning I wash my hands of it. Heknows well enough hisself he didn’t ought to be so late.”“The white for me as usual,” said Sir Giles. “I’m a sad, selfish, oldfellow, always appropriating the winning colour, eh, Patty? Never mind,you are coming on beautifully--you play a very pretty little game. I’mtraining you to beat myself, my dear, if not to-night, well, some othernight. Come along, don’t let’s waste any time if that old curmudgeongives us only half an hour.”Patty drew her chair to the table again with her most smiling aspect.“Here I am, dear papa,” she said. The renovated drawing-room, if it was,perhaps, in the taste of a past time and a little heavy and ungraceful,was a handsome room, abundantly lighted, with an atmosphere of warmthand luxurious comfort; and Patty in her black silk, with her haircarefully dressed _à la_ Jerningham, and her dress from a fashionablemantua-maker, recommended by that accomplished attendant--was as good animitation of what a lady at home ought to be, as it would be easy tofind; and as she sat there ministering to her old father-in-law, keepinghim in comfort and good humour, giving up her time and her attention toplay over again the same monotonous unending game--the picture, bothmoral and physical, was one that would have gained the admiration of anyspectator. But as she drew her chair again towards the table, thereflashed across Patty’s mind a remembrance of another scene: the parlourat the Seven Thorns full of a cloud of smoke and a smell of beer; therustic customers, with their slow talk, holding forth each to hisneighbour, calling with knocks upon the floor and table for furthersupplies; while she, Patty, the same girl, hastened to see what waswanted, and to bring them what they called for--she, Mrs. Piercey, thewife of the heir of Greyshott, the mistress of all this great house! Andit was only four months ago. How clearly she saw that scene! The samething would be going on to-night while she played backgammon with SirGiles, and smiled, and talked to her dear papa--and with a thrill ofmingled rage, vexation, and anxiety, Patty felt herself deserted and herhusband there! It gave her a pang which was all the more keen from herconfidence in what she could do, and her sense of the bondage whichprevented her from doing it. Oh, why should this old man go on with hiscackle and his dice, and his life which was no good to any one? Why, whycouldn’t he die and set her free? “Here I am, dear papa,” she said.“Perhaps that sleepy fellow, Gervase, will wake up and appear beforewe’ve done,” said Sir Giles. “I wouldn’t humour him too much, my dear.It’s one thing to be devoted to your husband, and another thing to lethim muddle his brains away. He sleeps a great deal too much, that’s myopinion. He’s not too bright at the best of times, and if you let himdrowse about like this it’ll do him harm--it’ll do him harm. I don’t seethat he gets up any earlier in the morning for sleeping like this atnight. His poor mother would never have permitted it. Sixes, my dear.No, no, you mustn’t humour him too much.”“What luck you have, dear papa! Oh, yes, I know, I know, he’s humouredtoo much. But some need more sleep than others: and don’t you think, onthe whole, it does him good? His mind comes out so much; he’s sosensible when you talk to him. I couldn’t wish for better advice thanGervase gives.”“I’m very glad to hear you say so, my dear; there’s a great deal in him,poor boy; I always said so; more than anybody knows. But I wouldn’t lethim sleep like that. What, Dunning, you old rascal, here again already?It can’t be half an hour yet.”“Oh, yes, dear papa,” said Patty, “it is the half-hour; and that lastthrow has quite made an end of me. Good-night, and I hope you’ll sleepwell. And I’ll go, as you say, and wake up that lazy boy. He _is_ a lazyboy. But I’ll try and break him of it now you’ve told me. I thought itwas best to humour him. But I’ll break him of it, now I know what youthink.”“Do, my dear, do!” said Sir Giles, nodding his head at her as he waswheeled away. Dunning gave Mrs. Gervase a look behind his master’schair. Ah, you may keep such a secret from those whom it affects most,but to keep it from the servants is more than any one can do! Dunningknew well enough where Gervase was. He knew how Gervase returned home,at what hour, and in what condition. Dunning, in addition, thought heknew that it was Patty’s doing, part of some deep-laid scheme of hers,and could not divine that the poor young woman’s heart was beating underthat fine gown with terror and anxiety. She gave a little gasp of reliefwhen the sound of Sir Giles’ chair died away, and his door was closedaudibly. And then she rang to have the lights put out, telling thebutler that Sir Giles and Mr. Piercey had both gone to bed; and thenPatty, heroic as any martyr, placed herself under Jerningham’s hands tohave her hair brushed, going through all the routine that nobody mightthink from her demeanour that anything was wrong. She was quivering withanxiety in every limb when she sent the maid away; and then, in herdressing-gown, stole downstairs to open the side door, and strain herears for the heavy footstep stumbling through the blackness of thenight.Poor Patty! what thoughts went through her mind as she kept that vigil!Fury and determination to do something desperate, to stop it at allhazards--and that this should be the last time, the very last! She wouldtake him by the shoulder and shake the very life out of him rather thanthat this should go on. She would fling herself at his feet and implorehim--alas, Patty knew very well that to implore and to threaten werealike useless, and that the fool would only open his moist mouth andlaugh in her face. What could she do? what could she do? She would makean appeal to her father, she would threaten him with the loss of hislicence, she would bribe him with all the money she could scrapetogether, she did not know what she would not do--but to bear thislonger was impossible! And then she fell into a dreary calm, and thoughtover all that had happened, her wonderful triumph, the change ineverything, the contrast. And yet what advance had she made if shenever, never could separate herself from the Seven Thorns? Whether itwas she who was there or her husband, what did it matter? Who would everacknowledge them or give them their own place if this were to go on? Oh,if these county people had but done as they ought, if they had but shownthemselves friendly and taken some notice of the young pair, people whohad known Gervase all his life, and ought to have felt for him! Pattyshed a few hot tears over the unkindness of the world, and then, as isso natural, her mind went back upon her own hopes, and the ideal she hadformed of her life which, as yet, was so little realised. She hadthought of herself as driving about the country, paying visits at thosegrand houses which had been to her as the abodes of the blest; herhusband at her side, well-dressed and well set up, with everybody sayinghow much he had improved! And invitations raining upon them, andfortune smiling everywhere. Sir Gervase and Lady Piercey! howdelightfully it had seemed to sound in her fortunate ears! To be sureall this could not be realised until poor old Sir Giles had been fullyconvinced that it was not for his advantage to live any longer; but thatmight have happened any day. Oh, if he could but be convinced of it now,and leave her free to care for her husband! Was not Gervase her firstduty? Why should this old man go on living, keeping his son out of hisown?And then Patty’s mind went back to the Seven Thorns, that place fromwhich it appeared she could not get free. She saw herself there beforeanything was yet settled, while all her life was before her. As she satalone and shivered and listened, the image of Patty, light-hearted andfree, came up before her like a picture. How busy she had been, howeverybody had admired her, even the old fellows in the parlour! And theyoung ones, how they had watched for a word with her, and some hadalmost come to blows! Roger, for instance, who had made so much fun ofthe Softy, who had looked such a gallant fellow in his brown velveteencoat and his red tie! She remembered how he had appealed to her not todo it, not to bind herself to a fool. The impudent fellow! to talk so ofGervase--Sir Gervase Piercey that was soon to be! Oh, poor Gervase, poorGervase! he was not, perhaps, very wise, but he could still be set rightagain and kept straight if she were but free to give herself upaltogether to the care of him. Roger Pearson could never have beenanything but a country fellow living in a cottage. It was true that hewas handsome, and all that. Patty seemed to see him, too, though she didnot wish it, with the light in his eyes, looking at her with his air ofmastery, the Adonis of the village. Every girl in the place had wantedRoger, but he had eyes for only her. Why did he come before her now? Shedid not want to see him or to think of him--far from that. There was nota fibre of the wanton in Patty’s nature. She had no understanding of thewomen who, with husbands of their own, could think of any other man. Andif she had the choice to make over again, she knew that she would do thesame; but still she could not help thinking of Roger Pearson, though shehad no idea why.This effect, however, was shortly after explained to her in the mosttrying way. The night grew darker and darker, and colder and colder. TheSeven Thorns must have been closed long ago, and all its revellersdispersed to their homes. What could have happened to Gervase? wherecould he have gone? Could he have taken so much that he was made to staythere, as unable to take care of himself, a thing which Patty couldremember to have happened in her time? She became afraid to look at herwatch or to listen to a clock, in the sickness of her heart. It wasimpossible but that he must have reached home long ago had he left theSeven Thorns in the natural way. Oh, where was he? where was he? Wherehad he gone? what had happened to him? Patty dared not go upstairs tobed, even when she was convinced that he could not be coming now; forher father, she was sure, would turn him out in the early morning ifthis was what had happened. Yet how could she remain up, and on thewatch, when the servants would be stirring, revealing what had happenedto the whole household? Patty is, perhaps, not a person for whom toappeal to the reader’s sympathies, but she was very unhappy, veryanxious, not knowing what to think.At last, in the blackest hour of the night, about three o’clock or so inthe morning, her anxious ear heard, or seemed to hear, a faint sound.Steps, and then a pause, and then steps again, and the sound of thelittle side gate in the beech avenue pushed open. Patty was immediatelyon the alert, with unspeakable relief in her mind. But the sounds werenot those of one man stumbling home. Sometimes there was a noise as ofsomething being tugged along the grass, then another stop, and the stepsagain making the gravel fly, and then the sound as of a fall. In herterror she stole out into the darkness, fearing she knew not what, andat last, by faint perception through the gloom, by sound, and by almostcontact in the stifling dark, perceived how it was--her husband,scarcely conscious, being dragged and hustled along through the dark byanother man.“Is it you, Gervase? oh, is it you, Gervase?” she cried.Oh, poor Patty! is there any one so hard-hearted as to refuse to pityher in her misery? The voice that answered her out of the blackness ofthe night was not that of Gervase. He uttered no sound but that of heavybreath. Yet it was a well-known voice, a voice that made her heart jumpto her throat with intolerable horror, anger, and shame--to hear howsober, manful, energetic, and capable it was.“There’s nothing wrong with him,” it said, clearly and quickly, “exceptthat he’s drunk. Show a light and I’ll get him in. I’ve had such a job,but I’ll manage now; only for goodness’ sake look sharp and show alight.”It was the voice of Roger Pearson, whom she had been thinking of, whosepresence had sent some subtle intimation through the air to bring him toher thoughts.Patty hurried back to the open door and brought out the candle, whichburned steadily in the motionless blackness of the air. She said not aword. Of the pang it gave her to see the man whom she had rejectedbringing back the man whom she had married she gave no sign. If shecould have covered her face that he might not see her, she would havedone so; but that being impossible, Patty never flinched. She held thelight to direct him, while now and then roused to take a step of his ownaccord, but generally dragged by the other, Gervase was got in. She ledthe way to the library, which was on the same level, stepping withprecaution not to be heard, shading the light with her hand, with allher wits about her. There was not a tinge of colour on Patty’s face. Shewas cold, shivering with excitement and distress. It was not tillGervase had been laid upon the sofa that she spoke.“I am sorry you have had this trouble,” she said. “I hope you have notover-strained yourself with such a weight. Can I get you anything?” Shelooked at him courageously in the face. It was right to offer a mansomething who had brought, even were it only a strayed dog, home.And he, too, looked at her, and for a moment said nothing. He stretchedhis arms to relax them.“I’m not a man that cares for the stuff,” he said, “but perhaps I’d benone the worse for a drop of brandy to take off the strain. He’s safeenough there,” he added. “You needn’t be anxious. He’ll wake up beforethe daylight, and then you can get him upstairs.”Patty did not say a word, but led the way to the dining-room, wherethere was brandy to be got. It was a thing any lady might have done, shesaid to herself, even through the wild beating of her heart, and thepassion in her breast--the passion of rage, and exasperation, and shame.He was cool enough, thinking more of stretching and twisting himself toease his muscles than of the silent anguish in which she was. When hehad swallowed the brandy he advised her, with rough friendliness, “Takea little yourself. It’s hard on you; you want something to give you alittle strength!”“Will you take any more?” said Patty, sharply.“No, I don’t want no more. It’s awful good stuff; it runs through a manlike fire. I’d been at a bit of an ’op over there by Coulter’s Mill, andI nigh fell over him lying out on the moor. He might have got his death;so when I saw who it was, I thought I’d best bring him home. But he’lltake no harm; the drink that’s in him will keep the cold out.”“I am much obliged to you,” said Patty. “If there’s any reward you’dtake----”“Meaning money?” he said, with a suppressed roar of a laugh. “No, Iwon’t take no money. I might say something nasty to you after that, butI won’t neither. It ain’t very nice for you, poor girl, to have your manbrought home in that state by your old sweetheart. I feel for you; butyou always had a sharp tongue, and you never would give in. I advise youto take more care of the Softy now you’ve got him back,” he said as hewent away.Patty shut and locked the door with an energy of rage and humiliationwhich almost overcame the horror of being heard. And then she went intothe library and sat beside her husband till he had sufficientlyrecovered from his stupor to be taken upstairs. What hours of vigil! Allthe sins of her triumph might have been expiated while she sat there andshivered through the miserable night.CHAPTER XXXVI.Patty had thoughts enough, surely, to occupy her that night, but it isdoubtful whether there were any that came into her mind with the samereality--repeated again and again, as if by accident the recollectionhad been blown back upon her by a sudden wind--as those careless wordsuttered by Pearson when he had described how he had found Gervase: “Ihad been at a little hop at Coulter’s Mill;” he said ’op, but thoughPatty had never used that manner of speech herself it did not hurt her.A little hop at Coulter’s Mill. Such things were going on while she wasshut up in the dismal grandeur of Greyshott. Girls were whirling roundwith their partners, receiving their attentions, which, though theymight be rough and not very refined, were all that Patty knew of thosedelights of youth; while she, Patty, whom they all envied, who was nowso far above them, sat and played backgammon with an old dotard, orwatched half the night for her Softy’s return. There were still suchthings, and Roger Pearson went to them! Patty had a soft place in herheart for Roger; she wished him no harm, and it might very well havebeen, had not Gervase and ambition come across her path, that she shouldhave been his wife; and though she wished him nothing but good, Pattydid hope that she had more or less broken his heart. She thought hewould never have wished to go to those sort of places again, where everytune that was played and every dance would remind him of her. Hiscareless speech took her, therefore, full in the breast, with astupefying surprise. And he did not say it as if it was anythingwonderful, but only as the calm ordinary of life, “I’d been at a little’op at Coulter’s Mill.” And he was returning about two o’clock in themorning, which showed that he had amused himself well. Could such thingsbe, and she out of them all? Every time this thought crossed her mind itgave her a new shock. It seemed almost impossible that such things couldbe.But at all events, it was a comfort that Gervase at last was roused andgot safely to his room before the servants were stirring, which it hadbeen Patty’s fear would not be possible. She had made up her story whatto say in case she had been surprised by the early housemaid. She meantto keep the door closed, and to say that Mr. Piercey had been ill in thenight and could not sleep, and now had fallen asleep on the sofa, andmust not be disturbed. Happily, however, it was not necessary to burdenher conscience with this additional fib. She got him upstairs safely,and to bed, and lay down herself upon the sofa with great relief. What anight! while all the girls who had been at the dance at Coulter’s Millwould still be sleeping soundly, and if they ever thought of Patty,would think of her with such envy! Poor Patty, she was very brave. Shesnatched a little sleep, and was refreshed before Jerningham came to thedoor with that early cup of tea, which Patty understood all the fineladies took in the morning. For once she was glad of that unnecessaryrefreshment. She told Jerningham that Mr. Piercey had been ill, and thatshe feared he had taken a bad cold; and then Patty closed the door uponthe maid, who guessed, if she did not already know exactly, thecharacter of the illness, and began to think steadily what she shoulddo. She would tell Gervase that another night, if it happened again, hewould be brought in dead, not alive. He would die, she would tell him,on the roadside like a dog. His was not a mind that could take in milderimaginations, but he would understand _that_. And Patty made up her mindto have another conversation with her father equally trenchant. Shewould tell him that if anything happened to Gervase she would have himtried for manslaughter. There would be abundant evidence, which shewould not hesitate to bring forth, that the victim was half-witted, thathe had been taken advantage of, and that the man who plied him withdrink and then turned him out, his poor brain more clouded than ever, tofind his way home, was his murderer and nothing else. Patty said toherself that she did not mind what scandals she would raise in suchcircumstances. If Richard Hewitt were brought to the scaffold she wouldnot mind, though he was her father. She would tell him that she woulddrag him there with her own hands. She set here fierce little teeth, andvowed to herself that she would ruin him were he ten times her father,rather than let _this_ go on. She would frighten Gervase to death; butbefore she was done she would set her foot on the ruins of the SevenThorns.Gervase, however, was too ill to be threatened the day after thatdreadful vigil. He had caught cold lying out upon the moor, and he wasvery ill and in a high fever, quite unable to get up, or to haveanything but nursing and kindness. Patty had the confidence of a womanwell acquainted with the consequences of a debauch, that this would wearoff in a short time and leave no particular results. She gave himbeef-tea and gruel and kept him quiet, and told him, like a child, thathe would be better to-morrow. “Gervase has caught a bad cold,” she toldSir Giles, “but you must not be anxious, dear papa. I am keeping him inhis warm bed, and he’ll be all right to-morrow.” “Right, right, mydear,” said Sir Giles. “Bed is the best place. There is nothing liketaking a cold in time, nothing like it. And we must remember he wasalways delicate. There’s no stamina in him, no stamina.” “He’ll be allright to-morrow,” Patty said, and she kept running up and down betweenthe games to see if he was asleep, if he was comfortable, if he wantedanything. “Good creature!” said Sir Giles, half to himself, half toDunning, who silently but consistently refused to appreciate Mrs.Piercey. “Now, what would you and I have done with the poor boy if hehad been ill, and no wife on the spot to look after him?” “Maybe hewouldn’t have had the same thing the matter with him,” said Dunning,significantly. “Eh, what do you mean? What’s the matter with him? He’sgot a bad cold,” cried Sir Giles. “There are colds and colds,” said theenigmatical Dunning. But Patty came back at the moment, saying thatGervase was quite quiet and asleep, and resumed her place for the secondgame. It was a longer game than usual, and Patty played badly, wishingher dear papa we will not venture to say how far off. But it came to anend at last, as everything does. “I hope you’ll have a good night, mydear, and not be disturbed with him,” the old gentleman said kindly.“Oh, I feel sure,” cried Patty, “he’ll be better to-morrow.” But, as amatter of fact, she was not at all sure. The fumes of the drink ought tohave died off by that time, but the fever had not died off. He was ill,and she was frightened and did not know what to do. And instead of beingbetter in the morning, poor Gervase was worse, and the doctor had to besent for, to whom, after various prevarications, poor Patty was obligedto confess the truth. Impossible to look more grave than the doctor didwhen he heard of this. “It was enough to kill him,” he said. Pattyunderstood (with a private reserve of vengeance against her father, whohad been the cause of it) that Gervase was really ill and had escapedsomething still worse. But she was confident in her own powers ofnursing, and did not take fright. She was really an excellent nurse,having a great deal of sense, and the habit of activity, and no fear ofgiving herself trouble. She devoted herself to her husband quitecheerfully, and even during the two first nights went down in a verypretty dressing-gown to play his game with Sir Giles. “We must not lookfor any change just yet, the doctor says, but he’ll soon be well, he’llsoon be well,” she said; and believed it so thoroughly that Sir Giles,too, was quite cheerful, notwithstanding that Dunning, in thebackground, shook his head. Dunning would have shaken his head whateverhad been the circumstances. It was part of his position to take alwaysthe worst view. And the household in general also took the worst view.Nobody had said anything about that fatal lying out on the moor. Mrs.Gervase certainly had not said a word (except to the doctor), and RogerPearson had resisted every temptation to betray his share in the matter;yet everybody knew. How did they know? It is impossible to tell. Thebutler shook his head like Dunning, and so did the cook. “He have noconstitution,” they said.But it was not till some days after that Patty began to take fright. Shesaid “He’ll be better to-morrow,” even after she saw that the doctorlooked grave--and resisted the aid of a nurse as long as she could,declaring that for a day or two longer she could hold out. “For he’s notgoing to be long ill,” she said, cheerfully. “Perhaps not,” the doctorreplied, with a tone that was exasperating in its solemnity. What didhe mean? “You must remember, Mrs. Piercey,” he continued, “that yourhusband has no constitution. Fortunately he has had no serious illnessbefore, but he has always been delicate. It’s common in--in such cases.He never had any stamina. You cannot expect him to throw off an attacksuch as this like any other man.”“Why not like any other man?” cried Patty. She was so familiar withGervase that she had forgotten his peculiarities. Except when shethought of it as likely to serve her own purpose with her father, shehad even forgotten that he was the Softy. He was her husband--part ofherself, about whom, assuredly, there was no fibre of weakness. “Whyshouldn’t he shake it off like any other man?” she cried angrily.The doctor gave her a strange look. “He has no constitution,” he said.The words and the look worked in Patty’s mind like some strange leaven,mingling with all her thoughts. She could not at first imagine what theymeant. After a while, when she was relieved by the nurse and went intoanother room to rest, instead of going to sleep, as she had, indeed,much reason to do, she sat down and thought it all over in the quiet. Noconstitution--no stamina. Patty knew very well, of course, what thesewords meant; it was the application of them that was difficult. Gervase!He was a little loose in his limbs, not very firmly knit perhaps, withnot so much colour as the rustics around--but he was young, andhealthy, and strong enough. Nobody had ever imagined that he was notstrong. As for being a little soft, perhaps, in the mind, that wasbecause people did not know him; and even if they did, the mind hadnothing to do with the body, and it was all in his favour, for he didnot worry and vex himself about things as others did. Like othermen--why wasn’t he like other men? He was as tall as most, he was notcrooked or out of proportion, he was----Did it mean that he might die?Patty rose from her chair and flung her arms above her head with a cry.She was not without natural affection; she liked her husband, and wasnot dissatisfied with him, except in that matter of going to the SevenThorns. She did not object to him because he was a fool; she was fond ofhim in a way. But when it suddenly flashed upon her that this might bethe meaning of what the doctor said, it was not of Gervase’s fate thatshe thought. Die! and deprive her of what she had made so many effortsto secure! Die! so that she never, never should be Lady Piercey, shouldshe live a hundred years! Patty stood for a moment all quivering withemotion as she first realised this thought. It was intolerable, and notto be borne. She had married him, coaxed him, kept him in good humour,given up everything for him--only for this, that he should die beforehis father, and leave her nothing but Mrs. Piercey--Mrs. Piercey only,and for ever! Patty raised her hands unconsciously as if to seize himand shake him, with a long-drawn breath and a sobbing, hissing “Oh!”from the very bottom of her heart. She had it in her mind to rush tohim, to seize him, to tell him he must not do it. He must make aneffort; he must live, whatever happened. It was inconceivable,insupportable that he should die. He must not, should not die before hisfather, cheating his wife! She stood for a moment with her handsclenched, as if she had in reality grasped Gervase by his coat, and thenshe flung herself upon her face on the sofa in a passion of wildweeping. It could not, could not be; it must not be. She would not allowthe possibility. Before his father, who was an old man--leaving all thehonours to--anybody, whoever happened to be in the way, MargaretOsborne, for anything she knew--but not Patty, not she who had workedfor them, struggled for them! It could not, and it must not be.Patty did not sleep that day, though she had been up all night andwanted sleep. She bathed her face and her eyes, and changed her dress,and went back to her husband’s bedside with a kind of fiercedetermination to hold by him, not to let him die. There was no change inhim from what there had been when she left him, and the nurse was halfoffended by her intrusion. “I assure you, ma’am, I know my duties,” shesaid, “and you’ll break down next if you don’t mind. Go, there’s a dear,and get some sleep; you can’t nurse him both by night and day. Andthere’s no change, nothing to make you anxious.”“You are sure of that, nurse?”“Quite sure. He’s quite quiet and comfortable, so far as I can see.”“But they say he has no constitution,” said Patty, gazing into thewoman’s face for comfort.“Well, Mrs. Piercey; but most times it’s the strongest man with whom itgoes hardest,” the nurse said.And this gave Patty great consolation; it was the only comfort she had.It was one of those dicta which she had heard often both about childrenand men, and therefore she received it the more willingly. “It goesharder with the strong ones.” That was the very commonest thing to say,and perhaps it was true. The old women often knew better than thedoctors, she said to herself. Indeed, there was in her mind a fargreater confidence in such a deliverance than in anything the doctorscould say.And nothing could exceed the devotion with which poor Gervase wasnursed. His wife was by his side night and day. She never tired--neverwanted repose; was always ready; the most careful and anxious of nurses.“He’s much better to-day, don’t you think?” was her greeting to thedoctor when he came. And Dr. Bryant said afterwards that Mrs. Pierceylooked as if she would have flown at his throat when he looked grave.She could not bear to be contradicted or checked in her hopes. And everyday she went downstairs and assured Sir Giles that his son would soon bebetter.“We can’t expect it to pass in a day,” she said, “for it is a veryserious attack.”“And he has no stamina, no stamina; we always knew it--we were alwaystold that,” said the old gentleman.Mrs. Piercey looked fiercely at her father-in-law, too. She could notbear to hear this repeated.“Dear papa,” she said, “it comes hardest always on the strongest men.”“God bless you, my dear!” cried old Sir Giles, falling a-sobbing, as washis wont when his mind was disturbed, “I believe that’s true.”Oh, how could he go on living--that old man for whom nobody cared; whodid nothing but keep the younger ones out of their own! What had he tolive for? Patty wondered, with a wild, yet suppressed rage which nowords could express; old, helpless, not able to enjoy anything exceptthat wretched, tedious backgammon, and keeping others out of their own;yet he would live and see Gervase die! He would go on, and on, and seehis only child buried, as he had seen his wife, and forget all about itafter a week, and play his backgammon, and be guarded by Dunning fromevery wind that blew. Dunning! Was it Dunning, perhaps, that kept himalive; that knew things which the doctors don’t know? It was natural toPatty’s education and training to think this, and that some privatenostrum would do more than all the drugs in the world.“Shall I send down a nurse to you for a moment,” she said to Sir Gilessuddenly, “and will you let Dunning come up and look at him?” Dunningcould not refuse to go, but he looked at Patty suspiciously, as if shemeant to betray him into some trap.“I don’t know nothing about that kind of illness,” he said.“Oh, but you don’t know what kind of illness it is till you see him,”cried Patty. She hastily led the man to her husband’s bedside, andwatched his looks while he stood awkwardly, holding as far aloof as hecould, looking down upon the half-sleep, half-stupor, in which thepatient lay.“Oh, Dunning, what do you think?”“I think as he looks very bad,” Dunning said, in a subdued and troubledvoice.“That’s not what I want you to tell me. I want you to think if there isanything we could give him to rouse him up. What he wants is to beroused up, don’t you see? When you are roused to see the need of it, youcan do a deal for yourself, however ill you may be. What could we givehim, Dunning, to rouse him up?”Dunning could see nothing but some unintelligible trap that was beinglaid for him in those words.“I’m not a doctor,” he said, sullenly. “I know what’s good for SirGiles, as is chronic; but I don’t know anything about the like of this.I should say there’s nothing to give him, but just wait and--trust inGod,” said Dunning.“Oh, God!” said Patty, in the unintentional profanity of her hot terrorand distress. He was so far off; so difficult to get at; so impossibleto tell what His meaning was! whereas she had felt that this man mighthave known something--some charm, some medicine which could be given atonce.“You had better go back to Sir Giles,” she said, shortly, and sat downherself by that hopeless bed. But it was not hopeless to Patty. As soonas Dunning was gone she began to take a little comfort even from what hehad said: “Wait, and trust in God.” Patty knew all that could be said inwords about trusting in God, and she knew many collects and prayers;but, somehow, even she felt that to ask God by any means, whateverhappened, to exert His power that she might be Lady Piercey in theend--that the old man might die and the young man live for thispurpose--was a thing not thought of in any collect: her mouth wasstopped, and she could not find a word to say.CHAPTER XXXVII.It was with nothing less than consternation that the county received theintelligence of Gervase Piercey’s death, which flew from house to housenobody could tell how; told by the early postman on his rounds, conveyedwith the morning’s rolls from the villages, brought up at a pace muchaccelerated by the importance of the news by grooms with letter-bags,and every kind of messenger. Gervase Piercey was dead: the Softy of thevillage--poor Sir Giles’ only son. Though he was a fool, he was SirGiles’ only child! There were ladies in the county who had wonderedwistfully whether, if he were “taken up” by some capable woman, he mightnot have been so licked into shape as to have justified that capablewoman in marrying him to her daughter. Nobody had been so brave as to doit, but several had speculated on the subject, thinking that, after all,to preserve a good old family from the dust, and hand on Greyshott tobetter heirs, might be worthy the sacrifice of a few years of a girl’slife. These ladies, though none of them had been brave enough to takethe necessary steps, felt doubly outraged by his marriage when it tookplace; and the consternation in their minds at the receipt of this lastpiece of news was tinged with something like remorse. Oh, if they hadbut had the courage! Maud or Mabel, if she had been forced to marry thatunfortunate simpleton, would, as they now saw, have been so swiftlyreleased! but it is needless to go back upon what might have been, afterthe contrary events. And now what a conjunction was this--what aterrible position for the poor old father! his only son taken from him;left alone with that woman in the house! Nobody knew anything aboutPatty; it was enough that she was Patty, and that she had married thatpoor half-witted young man. And then the question arose in a great manyhouses--What were they to do? They had not called upon Mrs.Gervase--nobody had called upon Mrs. Gervase--but how were they toapproach Sir Giles now, with that woman there? Poor old Sir Giles! hehad allowed her to take possession of his house for his son’s sake, nodoubt, and for peace, not being strong enough for any struggle, and whatwould he do now? Would he send her away, and thus be accessible again tohis old friends, or what would he do? This question occupied the mind ofthe neighbourhood very much for the day or two after the news wasreceived, and it became apparent that something must be done. The oldman could not be left alone in his trouble, unsolaced by any friendlyword; the details must be inquired into--the time of the funeral, sothat proper respect might be paid. Many people sent cards, and servantsto make the necessary inquiries, but one or two gentlemen wentthemselves, Lord Hartmore in particular, who as virtually the head ofthe county, and actually a very old friend, felt it incumbent upon himto carry his sympathy and condolence in person. Lord Hartmore wasreceived by a young lady in very deep mourning, already covered in crapefrom top to toe, and crowned with the most orthodox of widows’ caps. Shewas very quiet, but very firm.“I cannot allow any one to disturb Sir Giles,” she said; “he is verymuch broken down. Absolute quiet, and as little reference as possible tothe details of our great trouble, are indispensable, the doctor says.”Lord Hartmore was much surprised at the self-possession of the youngwoman, and at her language.“The tone of the voice was of course a little uneducated,” he said, “butshe talked, my dear, she talked as well as you or I, and made use of thesame expressions!”“Why, what other expressions could any one make use of?” cried LadyHartmore.“I said an old friend like myself should surely be made an exception;but she didn’t give in. ‘My father-in-law has seen none of his oldfriends for a long time,’ she said quite pointedly; ‘he is notaccustomed to seeing them. It would be a great agitation to him, and Iam charged to see that he is not disturbed.’ I assure you,” said LordHartmore, “I didn’t know what to say. We have all deserted him in themost horrid way. The young woman was right: to put in an appearancejust at this moment, not having shown since poor Lady Piercey’s funeral,might quite probably be very discomposing to the old man!”“And what about the funeral?” was the next question that was asked.“There, again,” said Lord Hartmore, “I can’t blame her. She’s met withno attention from us, and why should she take any trouble about us? Thefuneral is to be on Thursday; but she said, ‘My father-in-law will notgo. I can’t put him to such a trial. I will follow my husband to hisgrave myself, and I don’t know that I wish anybody else to take thetrouble.’ She carries things with a very high hand, but I can’t blameher, I can’t blame her,” Lord Hartmore said. It must be added that theconsternation of the county neighbours was increased by this report.Their consternation was increased, and so were their doubts as to whatthey should do; but at the same time their curiosity was piqued, and acertain sense of compunction rose in their bosoms. If it was merely therecklessness of disappointment and despair which moved Patty, or if itwas severe and subtle calculation, at least her policy was wonderfullysuccessful. There was a large attendance at poor Gervase’s funeral, atwhich she appeared alone, occupying by herself the blackest of mourningcoaches, and in such a depth of crape as never widow had worn before.But Mrs. Gervase was exceedingly _digne_ in her woe. She made nohysterical demonstration. She had none of her own people in attendanceupon her, as had been expected, though Richard Hewitt occupied aconspicuous position in the crowd, thrusting himself in among the countygentlemen in the procession. Patty stood by the grave all alone, and sawher hopes buried with real anguish. She fulfilled the part so well thatLord Hartmore (a candid man, as has been seen) could not contain himselffor pity, and stepped quietly forward to her side and offered his arm.She took it silently, but with a trembling and evident need of supportwhich went to the good gentleman’s heart. Poor thing, poor thing! thenshe had been really fond of him after all. Lord Hartmore reflectedsilently that to a girl in her position the defects of the poorhalf-witted fellow might not be so apparent, and if she loved him,strange as that seemed! He led her back to her carriage with an almostfatherly friendliness, the whole village looking on, all the othergentlemen a little ashamed of themselves, and Richard Hewitt’s red faceblazing through the crowd. “My wife will call to inquire for you,” hesaid, as he put her in, “and I hope that I may be admitted soon to seemy dear old friend, Sir Giles.” Patty answered only by a bow. It was allthat could be expected of the poor young new-made widow, who hadfulfilled this sad duty alone with no one to stand by her. Thespectators were all impressed, and even overawed, by Patty’s lonelinessand her crape and her youth.And she did in reality feel her downfall too much to get the good ofLord Hartmore’s civility, or indulge the elation which sprang up in hermind, instinctively accompanying the consciousness that everybody sawher leaning upon Lord Hartmore’s arm. Ah! what a thing that would havebeen a month ago! but now was it only a tantalising flutter before hereyes of what might have been, at present when all the reality was over?It would be unkind to Patty to say that no regret for poor Gervase inhis own person was in her heart. She had not been without affection forGervase, and the thought of his early death had been very sad to her atthe moment. Poor Gervase, so young, and just when better things mighthave been in store for him! But the mind very soon familiarises itselfwith such an event when there is no very strong sentiment in question.It was not Gervase, but herself, whom Patty chiefly mourned. After allshe had done and all she had gone through, to think that this was whatwas left to her--a position as insecure as that of any governess orcompanion, at the mercy of an old and ailing man, with one of herenemies at his ear. Oh, that it should be that old man, that useless,ailing old man, that should live and Gervase die! There seemed nojustice in it, no equity, no sense of right. Sir Giles had lived hislife and had all its good things, and there was no advantage to him orto any one in his continuance; whereas Gervase, Gervase! He, poorfellow, had it in his power to make his wife Lady Piercey, to secure herposition so that nobody could touch it. And it was he that had gone, andnot his father! Patty wept very real tears as she drove slowly homealone--real! they were tears of fire, and made her eyelids burn. Oh, howdifferent from the last time when she drove along that same road, thrustin anyhow, clambering up without a hand to help her, sitting byDunning’s side--but with all the world before her, and the sense of acoming triumph in her veins! Patty did not deceive herself about herposition now. A son’s widow is a very different thing from a son’s wife.The latter must be received, and has her certain place; the other is amere dependant, to be neglected at pleasure. And it all rested with SirGiles what was to become of her. He might keep her there as the mistressof his house, or he might make her a little allowance and send her away,desiring to see no more of her. Patty was altogether dependent, shefelt, on the caprice of the old man. She had as good as nobody but he inthe world, for she said to herself that nothing would induce her ever tospeak to her father again, who had murdered Gervase and all her hopes.She would never look at him with her free will, never speak to him. Thathe should have dared to come to the funeral was a sin the more. Never,never! Patty said to herself she would rather go out to service, ratherstarve! These five months had placed a gulf between her and the SevenThorns which nothing could ever bridge over. If it was suggested to herthat she should return home, as young widows often do, she would saythat she had no home, and it would be true. She would rather be aservant, rather starve!And then her mind went back to Sir Giles. What would he do with her?The old man liked her, she felt sure. And she had been good to him.Whatever her motives had been, whether they would bear scrutiny or not,she had been good to him. She had kept pain away from him as far as shecould. She had taken care of all his comforts. She had not permitted himto be disturbed. Dunning and all the rest would have thought itessential that he should go to the funeral and undergo all the miseryand excitement of that ceremony. But Patty had prevented that. He hadreason to be grateful to her; but would he be grateful? This was thetremendous question. Would he keep her there as the mistress of hishouse, or would he send her away? Patty had in her jewel-case, carefullylocked up, a letter from Margaret Osborne to her uncle, which shethought it wisest to keep back. If Sir Giles received it, it might makehim think that Mrs. Osborne was the best mistress for his house, whichshe was not, Patty felt sure. She put it aside, saying to herself thatsome time, when the excitement was over and everything had settled down,she would give it--but not now: to what purpose now? Poor Sir Gileswanted to forget his trouble, not to have it forced upon him bycondolences. Margaret had written to Patty also a short note full ofsorrow for poor Gervase, and asking whether it would be desirable thatshe should come to Greyshott for his funeral; to which Patty had repliedexplaining that everything was to be very quiet in consequence of thecondition of “dear papa.” “It is he that must be considered ineverything,” Patty wrote; “I have the doctor’s orders to keep him asmuch as possible from all emotion. I will bury my dear husband myself.Nobody else, as you know, has ever been very fond of him, and I shallnot ask anybody to come for the form’s sake. If possible, dear papa isnot to be told even the day. He is very broken and miserable, but whenhe is let alone and not reminded, he forgets.” Margaret had acceptedthis as a refusal of her visit, and she had asked no more. It would havebeen a painful visit in any case. Colonel Piercey was abroad. Therewere, therefore, no relations to come to make the occasion moredifficult for Patty, and yet there had been no want of “respect.” Thecounty magnates had all attended the melancholy funeral--where the youngwife alone was chief mourner. “Why did not Margaret come?” they allasked, and blamed her. But a feeling of sympathy arose for Patty allover the neighbourhood. The doctor spoke with enthusiasm of her devotionas a nurse, and her intelligence and understanding. Poor thing! Poorthing! Whatever her antecedents had been, and however she had acquiredthat place, she had certainly behaved very well; and now what was tobecome of her? people asked with pity. It was assumed that she wouldreturn to her friends, as other young widows did--though not in thiscase to her father’s house.If they had but known how anxiously she was herself debating thatquestion as she drove along in her crape and her woe, with the blindsdown, and every symptom of desolation! Dunning had not allowed hismaster to dine out of his own rooms, or to indulge in any diversion inthe evening, since the death of his son. If other people did not know orcare what was right, Dunning did, and at all events poor Mr. Gervaseshould be respected in his own house as long as he lay there. Above all,on the evening of the funeral day, Dunning was determined there shouldbe no relaxation of that rule. He was disposed to think, as were therest of the servants, that Patty’s reign was over; but the others weremore wary than Dunning, and did not show any signs of emancipation asyet. He did so with premature exultation, rejecting almost roughly hersuggestion that Sir Giles should dine as usual on that gloomy evening.“Master’s not equal to it,” said Dunning, “and if he was he didn’t oughtto be. I don’t hold with folks that dance and sing the day they’ve puttheir belongings in the grave--or eat and drink, it’s just the same.”“You forget what the doctor says, that nothing must be allowed to upsethim. I hope you don’t talk to Sir Giles on--melancholy subjects,” Pattysaid, with all the dignity of her widow’s cap.“I don’t know what subjects there can be but melancholic subjects inthis ’ouse of mournin’,” Dunning said.“Then I will come and see him myself,” said Patty. She went to SirGiles’ room accordingly, after his too simple dinner had been swallowed,and devoted herself to him.“I think we’ll send Dunning away for a little, dear papa,” she said.“We have things to talk of, haven’t we?--and Dunning has been on duty along time, and a little society will make him more cheerful.”“I beg your pardon, Sir Giles,” said Dunning, “but whatever some folksmay think I don’t ’old with being cheerful, not on the day of afuneral.”“What does he say, my dear? what does he say?” said Sir Giles. “But lookyou here, Dunning, whatever it is I won’t have Mrs. Pierceycontradicted. Do you hear, sir? Do as Mrs. Piercey tells you,” and hestruck his stick upon the floor.Dunning in consternation withdrew, for when Sir Giles was roused he wasnot to be trifled with.“She’s found out some d----d trick to come over the old man,” he saidin the housekeeper’s room to which he retired. But this was a mistake;for it was Sir Giles himself who had invented the trick. He turned toPatty with great tenderness when the man disappeared, and took her byboth hands and drew her to a chair beside him.“My dear,” he said, “I’ve forgotten, like an old sinner, what MegOsborne told me. I’ve been allowing you to do all sorts of things andwear yourself out. But it sha’n’t happen again, it sha’n’t happen again.Now that my poor dear boy is gone we must be more careful than ever--forit’s our last hope both for you and for me to have an heir for the oldhouse.”CHAPTER XXXVIII.It was Sir Giles himself who had found this charm which had so great aneffect on the after-history of Greyshott. Patty, among other qualitieswhich were not so praiseworthy, had the almost fierce modesty of theyoung Englishwoman, and would not have spoken on such a subject to aman, even so harmless a person as an old man like Sir Giles, for anyinducement. She did not even understand what he meant at first, and thesame impulse of _farouche_ modesty made her ashamed to explain, or domore than blush deeply and remonstrate, “Oh, dear papa!” as she wouldhave done probably in any case, whether his supposition had been falseor true. The old gentleman in his melancholy and confused musings overGervase, had suddenly remembered, the thought being recalled by somemerest trifle of association, the hurrahs of little Osy which hadmingled with his own feeble cheer on some forgotten occasion. Heremembered it suddenly as the strangest contrast to his feelings now.What had the old father, desolate and childless, to cheer about? Whathad he heard that could have produced that cheer? It was when Meg wasgoing away--when she had told him she was going to take Osy away fromhim. That was nothing to cheer about. What was it that had made himforget Osy, but which the dear little fellow had caught up and shoutedover, though it was an unkindness to himself? and then he recollectedall at once. What Mrs. Osborne had said had been the most common andordinary wish that children might arise in the old house, which was themost natural thing, the most certainly to be expected. She had meant nomore: but Sir Giles had at once attributed to Meg a knowledge which wasat the moment impossible, without reflecting either that she was thelast person to receive the confidence of Patty. He forgot now that itwas months since this had been said, and only remembered that it hadbeen said, and that the prospect was like life from death. Life fromdeath! That was what it would be--from his dead son an heir, in whom theold house might blossom and grow glad again. He took up the idea wherehe had dropped it with a sudden exhilaration which drove away allsorrow. An heir to the old house, a thing all made of hope, with none ofpoor Gervase’s deficiencies, a being whom the old man fondly hoped to“make a man of” even yet before he died.And it would not be too much to say that the first feeling of Patty,when she understood what the old gentleman meant, was one ofconsternation. She did not know how to answer him, how to tell him thatshe had no such hope. Her lips were closed partly by the tradition ofsilence on such subjects which an unsophisticated Englishwoman seldomsurmounts, and partly because she was so utterly astonished and takenaback by the suggestion. She did not even see the advantage in it, norhow it placed this feeble old man whose life hung on a thread in herhands. It was not till after she had left him and was alone, and couldthink, that these advantages occurred to Patty; and there was probablyno suggestion of a treacherous kind which it would have seemed to her soimpossible to make use of. The scruples of life are very much things ofcircumstance, that seeming quite legitimate and right to one which isthe height of immodesty and indelicacy to another. Patty had onedistinct object in her mind, now that all her hopes were over, which wasto induce her father-in-law, by whatever means were possible, to make aprovision for her. He was really, she felt, the only one to whom shecould now cling, her sole support and protection, and she meant to bealso his protector, to take care of him as he had never been taken careof before. All this she steadfastly intended, meaning nothing but goodto the ailing and desolate old man; but she also intended that he shouldprovide for her, as was her right as his son’s wife. Should Sir Gilesdie at the present moment, Patty was strongly and painfully aware thatshe would be in no way the better for having taken that step which hadseemed so prodigious a one, which had raised her so high above all herantecedents and belongings, by becoming Gervase Piercey’s wife. She wasMrs. Piercey, but she was without a penny, poorer by the burden of thatname than Patty Hewitt could ever have been. Her first duty, her firstdetermination was to be provided for, in whatever manner it might bemost possible to do that. But it is only just to her to say that thisway of influencing her father-in-law, and of moving him to do what shewished, had never occurred to her, and even when thus suggested it wasvery repugnant to her--the last thing she desired to do. But Patty, shutup in her room of widowhood and mourning, with her cap with its long,white streamers visible upon the table, and everything black about her,even the dressing-gown which she had put on to sit by the fire, and hermind so alert and unfatigued going over everything, speculating how bestto pluck from the nettle danger the flower of safety, could not shut outthe suggestion from her thoughts. It might even yet prove to be so, shesaid to herself, blushing hotly, even though she was alone. And if not,why shouldn’t she permit Sir Giles to think so? It would give him agreat deal of pleasure, poor old gentleman. It would tide him over theworst time, the immediate crisis of his son’s death, and it would doubleher every claim upon him, and make it more than ever necessary that heshould put her at once beyond the reach of want or suffering of anykind. Still, it was with reluctance that she accepted this weapon whichhad been thrust into her hand.Sir Giles could not get his new discovery out of his head. He toldDunning of it before he went to bed. It was whispered all through thehouse in the morning; and though some of the women scoffed and declaredit to be an invention, yet it was, of course, the most natural idea inthe world. From Patty not a word came, either in assertion or denial.She said nothing; she understood no hints; she never allowed herself tobe betrayed into reference to her supposed hopes. Sir Giles alone talkedto her on the subject with joyous laughter and chuckles, and a loudlyexpressed determination that she should be obeyed and not contradicted,which was of priceless value to Patty, at the moment when her sway was alittle uncertain, and when expectation was strong in the household thatshe should be displaced and Mrs. Osborne sent for in her place. Thehousehold by no means desired Mrs. Osborne in Patty’s place. Margarethad been too much and too long a dependant to be popular among theservants; and Patty, who was so peremptory, who had acted upon herconvictions, and managed to turn out everybody whom she feared ordisliked, had powerful recommendations in her imperious authority. Shemeant what she said, and could not be driven or persuaded out of it; andshe knew when work was well done, and gave the capable housemaid orcleaner of plate the praise which was his or her due. And she was notunjust, save in the case of personal disrespect to herself, which shenever pardoned--a quality which the servants’ hall entirely approved.Mrs. Osborne could be got to “look over” anything by judicious entreatyor representation, especially if it was a mere offence against herself,and was less respected and considered in consequence. It was not,therefore, in any way desired that she should take up the reins; yet,all the same, it made a great difference to Patty that Sir Giles hadtaken it into his head that she must not be contradicted. It establishedher once more firmly in her seat.And the little group in the great drawing-room in the evening was allthe more cheerful in consequence. It was, to look at, a forlorn groupenough: the old gentleman, more feeble than ever, with Dunning behindhis chair, ready to move it according to his caprice, and the youngwidow in her deep crape, a black spot upon the white and gold of theroom. Patty had been requested by Sir Giles to “take that thing off herhead,” and did so obediently in her father-in-law’s presence, though shewas far too determined to do her duty by her dead husband to dispensewith that symbol of grief on any other occasion. They sat with thebackgammon-board between them, playing game after game. There was inPatty’s mind unutterable relief from the misery and suspense which shehad suffered in Gervase’s lifetime; but other thoughts, scarcely lessanxious, occupied her fully. Yet she talked to the old gentleman with anendeavour to please and amuse him which was heroic. It was a greatstrain upon Patty. She could talk of herself without difficulty; shecould have talked, had she thought it expedient, of her father and aunt,and their sins against her; she could have talked of Gervase; but thesesubjects being all tabooed, it was very hard upon Patty to find anythingto say. She knew nobody whom Sir Giles knew. She could not tell him thenews, for she knew none, except the affairs of the village, whichinterested herself, and which she seized on greedily from every possiblechannel. But Patty could not talk on any other subject. She had to talkabout the backgammon, to remind him of the wonderful stroke he hadplayed last night, and the wonderful luck he had always; and how it wassuch an amazing chance for her to play, a poor ignorant thing as shewas, with such an accomplished player as dear papa. This was but ascanty thread to spin through night after night, and had it not beenmade up so much of applause it is very doubtful how long it would havesufficed. But there is nothing of which the ordinary mind can swallow somuch as praise; and when the interest of life is reduced to a game, theplayer thinks as much of his lucky chances and his skilful movements asif it were something of the highest importance; so that, on the whole,this talk did very well and kept them going. But still Patty had notventured to introduce her great subject--that provision for herselfwhich she felt became more and more important every day; for who couldtell whether any morning Sir Giles might not be found to have passedaway from this life altogether, or to be enclosed in the living tomb ofparalysis, unable to act or devise anything more.Lady Hartmore did not call next day as her lord had promised, but shedid call, and was received by Patty in full panoply of mourning and witha heart that beat loudly with suppressed excitement. Lady Hartmore wasneither so much touched by the sight of the young widow, nor sosympathetic as her husband had been. She examined Patty curiously, withsearching eyes, full not only of the superciliousness of rank, but ofthe experience of a much older woman, which Mrs. Gervase would haveopposed with defiance, but for the false pretence which, though she hadnever put it forth, and though it had arisen most innocently, gave hersomething of a sensation of guilt. This, however, though Patty was notaware of it, did her service with the great lady. It subdued her naturaldetermination, and gave an apparent softness to her aspect which did notbelong to it by nature. Lady Hartmore put a great many questions to theyoung widow: did she think of remaining at Greyshott, which must be somelancholy a place nowadays? did she think this last shock had very muchshaken Sir Giles? did she not feel it a great responsibility to be leftin charge of him? and many other such questions. To these Patty repliedvery properly that she could not possibly leave Sir Giles alone; that hehad been very kind to her, like a father, and that nothing would induceher to desert him; that he was very well on the whole, “quite himself,”and that she tried to be as cheerful as she could on his account. Shetook no notice of the question about leaving Greyshott. It was notindeed necessary to reply to it, when she had already made that answerabout the impossibility of leaving Sir Giles.“But you must want somebody to speak to,--somebody to take care of you,too,” said the great lady, meaning more than she said.“Oh, no,” said Patty; “I have always had very good health, I have neverbeen delicate. I am very fond of my dear father-in-law. He does not wantvery much--he is very easily amused, and so kind, always so kind. We dovery well all by ourselves--as well,” Patty added, with a sigh, “as inthe circumstances we could possibly do.”What could any one say to such perfect sentiments? Lady Hartmore wasbaffled in her inquisitions. “Still,” she said, “I should have thoughtthat some one who was a relation--some one of your own family--a womanto speak to----”“I am sure,” said Patty, “that Lady Hartmore knows my family are notlikely to be welcome at Greyshott; and I have but an old aunt who wasnever married, and therefore has no experience.” She blushed as she saidthis, and Lady Hartmore was very quick to take up the inference forwhich she was prepared. But Patty was too wise to be led into anyfurther disclosures or to answer any of the searching questions whichher ladyship proceeded to put.“How did you find the poor thing?” her husband asked when he joined herin the carriage--for Lord Hartmore had visited Sir Giles while LadyHartmore thus did her duty by Patty.“I found the poor thing very well and extremely well able to take careof herself,” said the lady. “I don’t think you need waste so muchsympathy upon her.” But Lord Hartmore was full of feeling, and could notbe persuaded to take this view.“The poor old fellow is quite exultant,” he said. “It is a wonderfulblessing for him, whatever you may think of it in any other connection.It has given him a new lease.”“I don’t believe a word of it,” said Lady Hartmore.“Oh, come!” cried her husband. “It is one thing to trust your ownjudgment, which is an excellent one, I don’t gainsay it--but quiteanother to set it up against those who must know the facts best. By theway, he bewildered me by saying Meg told him. Has Meg been here?”“Not that I know of; but she may have made a hurried run to see heruncle. If Meg told him----” said Lady Hartmore, in subdued tones. Sheadded after a pause, “I shall think more of her if Meg is her_confidante_.”Thus on the whole the impression was favourable to Patty, even thoughthe grounds upon which it was formed were false.After this visit Patty took her first active step towards theaccomplishment of her desires. Sir Giles, who had been pleased with theHartmore visit and augured great things from it, opened the way byasking if she had not liked Lady Hartmore and found her kind? “A nicewoman, a good-hearted woman,” he said.“Yes, dear papa; but one thing she said gave me a great deal of pain;for she seemed to think I should go back to my family, and leave you,”she said, putting her handkerchief to her eyes.“Leave me? nonsense!” said Sir Giles, “I sha’n’t let you leave me, mydear. I shouldn’t have sent you away, anyhow, you may be sure; no, no, Ishouldn’t have sent you away; but in present circumstances, mydear--Why, you’re all our hope at Greyshott, you’re all our stand-by,you’re--you’re our sheet-anchor.”“How kind, how kind you are, dear papa! I try to do my best to keepeverything straight, though I never could pretend to be of so muchconsequence as that. But people feel free to speak,” said Patty, with asigh, “because they know I have no ground to stand on. I wasn’t dearGervase’s equal when he married me, and there were no settlements oranything, you know; and I am quite dependent, quite dependent, as muchas a servant--but without any wages,” Patty added, with a faint laugh.It was at one of the rare moments when Dunning was absent, intervals ofwhich Patty eagerly took advantage. Dunning was, indeed, a thorn in herflesh, though after mature deliberation she had decided that it waswiser to retain him, that he might take the responsibility of Sir Giles’health.“Dependent!” cried Sir Giles, “nonsense, nonsense! A servant, my dear?Don’t let me hear such a word again. No, no; no, no; never could havebeen so, for you’ve been quite a daughter, quite a daughter. But, in thepresent circumstances----”“Ah, dear papa, don’t let us think of that. I love to be with you--it’sthe only comfort I have; but still I can’t forget that I have noprovision. I might have to go away and work for my living, if somebodywere to over-persuade you, or if you were--ill or anything. A Mrs.Piercey having to work for her living--or perhaps take a situation! Ishouldn’t mind it for myself, but when I think, dear papa, of yourname.”“Good Lord!” cried Sir Giles, “you must be out of your mind, my dear, tothink of such a thing. My poor boy’s wife, and a good wife to him, too,if he had but lived to profit by it. That’s all nonsense, all nonsense,my dear.”“Ah, dear papa! but it would not be nonsense if I had not you to trustto,” cried Patty, laying her hand upon his arm. “It is you who are mysheet-anchor. I have not a penny of my own, not even to pay for mymourning; and I can’t earn any for myself, don’t you know, because ofdear Gervase and your name--the first in the county. I couldn’t take inneedlework, could I, in Greyshott? and a woman, you know, has alwayslittle expenses----”“My dear,” said Sir Giles, “have all the fal-lals you can set your faceto, and send in the bills to me; you’ve nothing to do but send in thebills to me.”“Dear papa! as if I ever doubted your kindness. It is not fal-lals I amthinking of; this,” cried Patty, holding up her crape, “is not much ofa fal-lal, is it? But what I am thinking of is the time to come, when Ishall require to have a little provision or income or salary of my own.”“Do you mean,” cried the old man, in the half-sobbing tone into which hewas betrayed by any emotion, “when--when--I’m no more; when I’m dead? Isthat what you mean?”Patty stooped down and laid her face against the large old limp hand,which reposed on the arm of Sir Giles’ chair. “I hope I’ll be dead, too,before that,” she said; “for what should I have to live for then?”This, it need not be pointed out, was no answer to his question; but itseemed so, and Sir Giles was much affected and sobbed, which Pattyechoed with a deep sigh or two which seemed to give a more refinedexpression to his feeling. He put his other hand upon her head.“Please God, we’ll see better days before that,” he said.And then Dunning came back, and a new game was begun.CHAPTER XXXIX.It was not till some days after this, that Sir Giles referred to thesubject again. Patty thought it had entirely failed to make anyimpression on his mind, and that she must herself renew theconversation, when he surprised her by saying suddenly, as if there hadbeen no interval, “It won’t be necessary, my dear, it won’t benecessary. As his mother, everything will be in your hands.”“Dear papa!” she cried, with a quite natural start; “how you frightenedme!”“I don’t want to frighten you, my dear; anything but that--anything butthat! But you must see that any little arrangements we might make wouldbe all needless, quite needless. Of course, everything will go to thenatural heir. There will probably be a long minority, for you know, mydear, with the best intentions in the world, an old fellow like me----though I would give half my kingdom to see him come of age--half mykingdom! But no, no, that’s a selfish thought; for I should wish him tohave the property unimpaired, if not added to--if not added to. You’lltake great care of it, I am sure. You’re quite a woman of brains.” SirGiles spoke very fast, to get through this long effort of thought andconsideration before Dunning came back. Then he added, with his usualmingled outburst of laughing and sobbing, patting her arm with his largeold nerveless hand, “So you see it’s needless, needless, my dear, foreverything will be in your hands.”“Dear papa!” cried Patty. She was silent for some time in confusion andembarrassment. Then, “There’s nothing certain in this world,” she said.“What, what?” cried Sir Giles. “Nothing’s happened--nothing’s happened,my dear? I hope you don’t mean to tell me that?”“Nothing has happened, dear papa,” cried Patty, with a painful flushupon her face. She had not meant to deceive him, and certainly not inthis way. It was indeed hard upon her that she had, without any fault ofhers, this fiction to keep up. “But there’s nothing certain in thisworld,” she said. “Who would have thought five months ago that I shouldneed to be thinking of a little provision for myself--I, that wasGervase’s wife, and had no need to think of anything? I married himwithout a thought of having anything settled on me, or even wanting apenny but what he gave me.” Patty put her handkerchief to her eyes toabsorb some real tears, for though her grief for poor Gervase couldscarcely be expected to be very profound, her pity for herself wassincere and lasting. “Dearest papa! I can’t bear to ask for myself.I’ve always been used to work, and I could get my own living at anytime. It is just that I can’t bear, being Mrs. Piercey, that I shouldhave to do it in that way--Gervase’s widow, with _your_ name.”“Don’t, my dear, don’t! For goodness’ sake don’t agitate yourself! Don’tcry, my dear, don’t cry!” said Sir Giles, anxiously.“Oh, I wouldn’t cry if--if I could help it. I would do nothing to vexyou, dear papa. But when I think of all that has happened--oh, whoshould know so well as I that there’s nothing certain in this world!”“My dear, my dear, I’ll send for Pownceby to-morrow. You must not upsetyourself--you mustn’t, indeed. What should I do, and everybody, if--ifanything was to happen?” Sir Giles cried. And he became so excited inhis anxiety to calm her, that Patty was compelled to conquer herself andregain her self-command. She looked up with a mournful smile from herpocket-handkerchief. “Dear papa,” she said, “we are two of us thatmustn’t do that. If you get upset it will upset me, and that will upsetyou still more; so we must each hold up for the sake of the other.Suppose we have another game?”“You always know exactly what I want,” said the old gentleman, his sobturning into a laugh, as his laugh so often turned into a sob. There wasnot, in fact, much difference between the two; and the rest of theevening was passed as usual in admiring exclamations on Patty’s part asto his wonderful play and wonderful luck, so that even Dunning did notsuspect that there had been anything more.Patty reminded her father-in-law next morning when she went to him, asshe had begun to make a practice of doing, to see if he wanted anyletters written, that he had spoken of some Mr. Pownceby who was to bewritten to. “I don’t know who Mr. Pownceby is, but you said somethingabout him, dear papa!” And the result was that in a day or two Mr.Pownceby came, the family solicitor, whom Patty indeed did not know, butof whose faculties and position in the matter she had a shrewd guess.She had to entertain the little gentleman to luncheon after he had beencloseted with Sir Giles all the morning; and Mr. Pownceby was muchimpressed by Mrs. Piercey’s dignified air, and her crape and her widow’scap. “I suppose it’s within the range of possibilities that a girl inthat position might be fond even of a poor fellow like Gervase Piercey,”he said to himself doubtfully; and he made himself very agreeable to theyoung widow. He informed her that he had received instructions to chargethe estate with an annuity of a thousand pounds a year for her, of whichthe payments were to begin at once. “A very proper arrangement,” hesaid, and he was impressed by the composure with which Patty receivedthe information. She was not indeed at all elated by it. A thousandpounds a year was a great thing for Patty Hewitt of the Seven Thorns.She would have thought it a princely revenue when she became GervasePiercey’s wife; but a few months’ familiarity with the expenditure ofGreyshott had made a great change in Patty’s views. To descend into asmall house like the Rectory, for instance (she had once thought theRectory a palace), and to do without a carriage, was far from anagreeable prospect. “How shall I ever do without a carriage?” Patty saidto herself, and she thought with scorn of the little basket-workpony-chaise which was all the rector could afford. Was it possible thatshe should ever come down to that? Mr. Pownceby, when he went away, heldher hand for a moment, and asked whether a very old friend of thefamily, who had known poor dear Gervase from his birth, might bepermitted to say how pleased and thankful he was that there werehopes----? which made Sir Giles so very happy, poor old gentleman? “AndI fear, I fear, my dear old friend has not many days before him,” thelawyer said; “he’s quite clear in his mind, but it was not to beexpected that a worn-out constitution could bear all those shocks oneafter another. We’ll not have him long, Mrs. Piercey, we’ll not have himlong!”“Does the doctor say so?” asked Patty.“My dear lady, the doctor says he has the best of nursing; andeverything so much the better for a lady in the house.” It was with this_douceur_ that the solicitor took his leave, being a man that liked toplease everybody. And there can be no doubt that a softened feelingarose in the whole neighbourhood about Patty, who was said to be such agood daughter to Sir Giles. “Thrown over her own people altogether--nocrowd of barbarians about the house, as one used to fear; and quitegives herself up to her father-in-law; plays backgammon with him halfthe day, which can’t be lively for a young woman; and expects----” Theselast were the most potent words of all.Patty was, indeed, very good to her father-in-law, and that notaltogether for policy, but partly from feeling; for he had been kind toher, and she was grateful. The winter was dreary and long, and therewere sometimes weeks together when Sir Giles could not get out, eveninto the garden, for that forlorn little drive of his in the wheeledchair. Patty gave herself up to his service with a devotion which wasabove all praise. She bore his fretfulness when weakness and sufferingmade the old man querulous. She was always at hand, whatever he wanted.She looked after his food and his comfort, often in despite of Dunningand to the great offence of the cook, but both these functionaries hadto submit to Patty’s will. Had she not carried everything with a veryhigh hand, it is possible that her footing might not have been so sure;for the women soon penetrated the fiction, which was not indeed ofPatty’s creation, and Dunning even ventured upon hints to Sir Giles thatall was not as he thought. The old gentleman, however, got weaker day byday; one little indulgence after another dropped from him. March wasunusually blustery, and April very wet. These were good reasons why heshould not go out; that he was more comfortable in his chair by thefire. Then he got indifferent to the paper, which Dunning always read tohim in the morning, and only took an interest in the scraps of newswhich Patty repeated to him later on.“Why did not Dunning read me that, if it is in the paper? The fellowgets lazier and lazier; he never reads the paper to me now! He thinks Iforget!” When Dunning would have remonstrated Patty checked him with alook.“You must never contradict Sir Giles!” she said to him aside.“And he says I’m never to contradict _her_!” Dunning said indignantly inthe housekeeper’s room, where he went for consolation; “between them aman ain’t allowed to say a word!”The women all cried out with scorn that Sir Giles would find outdifferent from _that_ one o’ these days.“Then he’ll just die,” said Dunning. Things had come to a very mournfulpass in the old melancholy house.By degrees the backgammon, too, fell out of use. Patty sat with himstill in the evening, but it was in his own room, often by his bedside,and many, many conversations took place between them, unheard by anyone. Dunning would catch a word now and then, as he went and came, andgathered that Sir Giles was sometimes telling her of things he wouldlike to have done, and that sometimes she was telling him of things shewould wish to be done.“As if she had aught to do with it!” Dunning said with indignation.Dunning, observing everything, imagined, too, that Sir Giles began togrow anxious about those expectations which were so long delayed. Hisattendant sometimes heard mutterings of calculation and brokenquestioning with himself from the old gentleman.“It’s a long time to wait--a long time--a long time!” he said.“What is a long time, Sir Giles?” Dunning ventured to ask--but was toldto hold his tongue for a fool.One day, towards the end of April, he suddenly roused from a long museor doze by the fire, and called to Dunning to send a telegram forPownceby.“Tell him to come directly. I mayn’t be here to-morrow,” Sir Giles said.“Are you thinking of changing the air, Sir Giles?” said the astonishedservant.The rain was pouring in a white blast across the park, bending all theyoung trees one way, and pattering among the foliage.“Air!” said the old man; “it’s nothing but water; but I’m soon going tomove, Dunning, as you say.”“Well, it might do you good, Sir Giles, a little later--when theweather’s better.”Sir Giles made no reply, but Dunning heard him muttering: “She alwayssays there’s nothing certain in this world.”Mr. Pownceby came as quick as the railway could bring him.“Is there anything wrong?” he asked of Mrs. Piercey, who met him at thedoor.“Oh, I am afraid he’s very bad,” said Patty; “I am afraid he’s not longfor this world.”“Why does he want me? Does he want to change his will?”“I don’t know--I don’t know. Oh, Mr. Pownceby, I don’t know how to sayit. I am afraid he is disappointed: that--that you said to me lasttime----”“Was not true, I suppose?” said the father of a family, who was notwithout his experiences, and he looked somewhat sternly at Patty, whowas trembling.“I never said it was,” she said. “It was not I. He took it into hishead, and I did not know how to contradict him. Oh, don’t say to himit’s not true! rather, rather let him believe it now. Let him die happy,Mr. Pownceby! Oh, he has been so good to me! Say anything to make himdie happy!” Patty cried.The lawyer was angry and disappointed, too; but Patty’s feeling wasevidently genuine, and he could not help feeling a certain sympathy withher. Sir Giles was sitting up in bed, ashy white with that pallor of oldage which is scarcely increased by death.“I’m glad you’re come in time, Pownceby--very glad you’re come in time.I’m--I’m going to make a move; for change of air, don’t you know, asDunning says. Poor Dunning! he won’t get such an easy berth again. Mywill--that’s it. I want to change--my will. Clear it all away,Pownceby--all away, except the little legacies--the servants andthat----”“But not Mrs. Piercey, Sir Giles? If--if she’s been the cause ofany--disappointment; it isn’t her fault.”“Disappointment!” said the old man. “Quite the contrary. She’s been justthe reverse. It was a good day for me when she came to the house. No, Idon’t mean that it was a good day, for it was my poor wife’s funeral;but if anybody could have made a man of Gervase she would have done it.She would have done it, Pownceby. Yes, yes; sweep her away! sweepeverybody away! I give and bequeath Greyshott and all I have--all Ihave, don’t you know? Gerald Piercey can have the pictures if he likes;she won’t care for them to----”The old man was seized with a fit of coughing, which interrupted him atthis interesting moment. Mr. Pownceby sat with his pen in his hand andmany speculations in his mind. To cut off his daughter-in-law’s littleincome even while he praised her so! And who was the person to whom itwas all to be left without regard for the rest? Meg Piercey, perhaps,who was one of the nearest, though she had never been supposed to haveany chance. The lawyer sat with his eyes under his spectacles intentlyfixed upon Sir Giles, and with many remonstrances in his mind. Mrs.Gervase might be wrong to have filled the poor man with false hopes; butto leave her to the tender mercies of Meg Piercey, whom she hadvirtually turned out of the house, would be cruel. Sir Giles began tospeak before his coughing fit was over.“She says, poor thing,” and here he coughed, “she s--says that there’snothing--nothing certain in this world. She’s right, Pownceby--she’sright. She--generally is.”“There’s not much risk in saying that, Sir Giles.”“No, it’s true enough--it’s true enough. It might grow up like itsfather. God grant it otherwise. You remember our first boy, Pownceby?Wasn’t that a fellow! as bold as a lion and yet so sweet. His poormother never got over it--never; nor I neither, nor I neither--though Inever made any fuss.”Was the old man wandering in his mind?“I hoped it would have been like him,” said Sir Giles, with a sob. “Ihad set my heart on that. But none of us can tell. There’s nothingcertain, as she says. It might grow up like its father. I’ll make allsafe, anyhow, Pownceby. Put it down, put it down--everything to----”“Sir Giles! to whom? Everything to----?”“Why, Pownceby, old fellow! Ah, to be sure he doesn’t know the firstname. Sounds droll a little, those two names together. Quick! I want itsigned and done with, in case I should, as Dunning says--don’t you know,change the air.”“But, Sir Giles!” cried the lawyer, in consternation: “Sir Giles!” headded, “you don’t mean, I hope, to leave the property away from thefamily and the natural heir?”“What a muddlehead you are, Pownceby!” said Sir Giles, radiant. “Why, Itwill be the natural heir. It will be the head of the family. And it willgrow up like our first boy, please God. But nothing is certain; andsupposing it was to turn out like its father? My poor boy, my poorGervase! It wasn’t as if we weren’t fond of him, you know, Pownceby. Hispoor mother worshipped the very ground he trod on. But one can’t helphoping everything that’s good for It, and none of the drawbacks--none ofthe drawbacks. Make haste, Pownceby; draw it out quick! You’re quickerthan any clerk you have, when you’ll take trouble. Nothing’s certain inthis world; let’s make it all safe, Pownceby, however things may turnout.”“I’ll take your instructions, Sir Giles--though I don’t like the job.But it’s a serious matter, you know, a very serious matter. Hadn’t youbetter think it over again? I’ll have the will drawn out in proper form,and come back to-morrow to have it signed.”“And how can you tell that you’ll find me to-morrow? I may have moved onand got a change of air, as Dunning says. No, Pownceby, draw upsomething as simple as you like, and I’ll sign it to-day.”The solicitor met Mrs. Piercey again in the hall as he went out. He hadnot been so kind on his arrival as she had found him before; but now hehad a gloomy countenance, almost a scowl on his face, and would havepushed past her without speaking, with a murmur about the train whichwould wait for no man. Patty, however, was not the woman to be pushedaside. She insisted upon hearing his opinion how Sir Giles was.“I think with you that he is very ill,” he replied, gloomily, “and inmind as well as in body----”“Oh no,” cried Patty, “not that, not that! as clear in his head, Mr.Pownceby, as you or me.”He gave her a dark look, which Patty did not understand. “Anyhow,” hesaid, “he’s an old man, Mrs. Piercey, and I don’t think life has manycharms for him. We have no right to repine.”Mr. Pownceby had known Sir Giles Piercey all his life, and liked himperhaps as well as he liked any one out of his own family. But torepine--why should he repine, or Patty any more, who stood anxiouslyreading his face, and only more anxious not to betray her anxiety thanshe was to hear what, perhaps, he might tell? But he did not do this.Nor would he continue the conversation, nor be persuaded to sit down. Heasked that he might be sent for, at any moment, if Sir Giles expressed awish to see him again. “I will come at a moment’s notice--by telegraph,”he said, with a gloomy face, that intended no jest. And he added stillmore gloomily, “I believe it will be for your advantage, too.”“I am thinking of my father-in-law and not of my advantage,” Patty saidwith indignation. The anxiety in her mind was great, and she could notdivine what he meant.CHAPTER XL.Margaret Osborne had lost no time in settling down in a cottageproportioned to her means, with her little boy and the one maid, who didall that was necessary, yet as little of everything as was practicable,for the small household. The place she had chosen was not very far fromGreyshott, yet in the impracticability of country roads, especiallyduring the winter, to those who are out of railway range, almost as farapart as if it had been at the other end of England. The districtaltogether had not attained the popularity it now enjoys, and thevillage was very rural indeed, with nobody in it above the rank of therustic tradesmen and traffickers, except the inevitable parson and thedoctor. The vicar’s wife seized with enthusiasm upon the new inhabitantas a representative of society, and various others of the neighbouringclergywomen made haste to call upon a woman so well connected, as didalso the squire of the place, or, at least, the ladies belonging to him.But Mrs. Osborne had no such thirst for society as to trudge along themuddy roads to return their visits, and her income did not permit eventhe indulgence of the jogging pony and homely clothes-basket of a littlecarriage, in which many of the clerical neighbours found great comfort.She had to stay at home perforce, knowing no enlivenment of hersolitude, except tea at the vicarage on rare occasions. Tea at thevicarage in earlier and homelier days would have meant a quiet share ofthe cheerful evening refreshments and amusements, when the guest wasmade one of the family party, and all its natural interests andoccupations placed before her. But tea, which is an afternoonperformance and means a crowd of visitors collected from all quarters,in which the natural household is altogether swamped, and the guest seesnot her friends, but their friends or distant acquaintances, of whom sheneither has nor wishes to have any knowledge--is a very differentmatter. At Greyshott there had been occasional heavy dinner-parties, inwhich it was Margaret’s part to exert herself for the satisfaction, atall events, of old friends, most of whom called her Meg, and had knownher from her girlhood. These were not, perhaps, very entertainingevenings, but they were better than the modern fashion. She lived,accordingly, very much alone with Osy, and the maid-of-all-work, whom,knowing so little as she did of the practical arrangements of ahousehold, she had to train, with many misadventures, which would havebeen amusing had there been anybody with whom she could have laughedover her own blunders and Jane’s ignorance. But alas! there was no one.Osy was too young to be amused when his pudding was burned or hispotatoes like stones. He was more likely to cry, and his mother’sanxiety for his health and comfort took the fun out of the ludicrous,yet painful, errors of her unaccustomed house-keeping. It depends somuch on one’s surroundings whether these failures are ludicrous ortragical. In some cases they are an enlivenment of life, in others anexaggeration of all its troubles. These, however, were but temporary;for Mrs. Osborne, though she knew nothing to begin with, and did noteven know whether she was capable of learning, was, in fact, too capablea woman, though she was not aware of it, to be long overcome by troublesof this kind; and it soon became a pleasure to her and enlivenment ofher life to look after her own little domestic arrangements, and carryforward the education of her little maid-servant. There was not, afterall, very much to do--plenty of time after all was done for Osy’slessons, and for what was equally important, Margaret’s own lessons,self-conducted, to fit her for teaching her boy. At seven years old alittle pupil does not make any very serious call upon his teachers, andthough Margaret was aware of having no education herself, she was stillcapable of as much as the little fellow wanted, except in oneparticular. Osy had, as many children have in the first stage, aprecocious capacity for what his mother called “figures,” knowing nobetter; for I doubt whether Margaret knew what was the differencebetween arithmetic and mathematics, or where one ends and the otherbegins. Osy did in his own little head sums which made his mother’shair stand erect on hers. She was naturally all the more proud of thisachievement that she did not understand it in the least. She was evendelighted when Osy found her all wrong in an answer she had carefullyboggled out to one of those alarming sums, and laughed till the tearscame into her eyes at the pitying looks and apologetic speeches of herlittle boy. “It isn’t nofing wrong, Movver,” Osy said. “Ladies never,never do sums.” He stroked her hand in his childish compassion, anxiousto restore her to her own esteem. “You can wead evwyfing you sees in anybook, and write bof big hand and small hand, and understand evwyfing;but ladies never does sums,” said Osy, climbing up to put his arms roundher neck and console her. These excuses for her incapacity were sweeterto Margaret than any applause could have been, and such incidents soongave pleasure and interest to her life. It is well for women that fewthings in life are more delightful than the constant companionship of anintelligent child, and Margaret was, fortunately, capable of taking, notonly the comfort, but the amusement, too, of Osy’s new views of life.These, however, we have not, alas! space to give; and as she was obligedto engage the instructions of the village schoolmaster for him in theone point which was utterly beyond her, Osy’s mathematical genius andhis peculiar phraseology soon died away together. He learned topronounce the “th,” which is so difficult a sound in English, and hiscondition of infant prodigy in respect to “figures” and all the wondersof his mental arithmetic came to an end under the prosaic rules of Mr.Jones, as such precocities usually do.Margaret’s life, however, had thus fallen into a tolerably happy vein,full of cheerful occupation and boundless hope and love--for whateminence or delight was there in the world which that wonderful childmight not reach? and to be his mother was such a position, she felt, asqueens might have envied--when the news of her cousin’s death broke uponher solitude with a sudden shock and horror. She had heard scarcelyanything about him in the interval. One or two letters dictated toDunning had come from her uncle in answer to her dutiful epistles, butnaturally there was no communication between her and Patty, and Gervasehad scarcely ever written a letter in his life. Sometimes at longintervals Lady Hartmore had taken a long drive to see her, but thatgreat lady knew nothing about a household which nobody now ever visited.“I might give you scraps I hear from the servants,” Lady Hartmoresaid,--“one can’t help picking up things from the servants, though I amalways ashamed of it,”--but these scraps chiefly concerned the “ways” ofMrs. Piercey, which Margaret was too loyal to her family to like to hearlaughed at. Gervase dead! it seemed one of those impossibilities whichthe mind feels less power of accustoming itself to than much greaterlosses. Those whom our minds can attend with longing and awe into theeternal silence, who are of kin to all the great thoughts that fill it,and for whom every heavenly development is possible, convey no sense ofincongruity, however overwhelming may be the sorrow, when they areremoved from us. But Gervase! How hard it was to think of him gaping,incapable of understanding, on the verge of that new world. Who couldassociate with him its heavenly progress, its high communion? Gervase!why should he have died? it seemed harder to understand of him whosedeparture would leave so slight a void, whose trace afar would befollowed by no longing eyes, than of one whose end would have shaken thewhole world. The news had a great and painful effect upon Margaret,first for itself, and afterwards for what must follow. She wrote, as hasbeen said, to her uncle, asking if she might go to him, if a visit fromher would be of any comfort to him; and she wrote to Patty with herheart full, forgetting everything in the pity with which she could notbut think of hopes overthrown. Patty replied with great propriety, notconcealing that she had kept back Margaret’s letter to Sir Giles,explaining how little able he was for any further excitement, and thatall that could be done was to keep him perfectly quiet. “He might wishto see you, but he is not equal to it,” Patty said; and she ended bysaying that her whole life should be devoted to Sir Giles as long as helived, “for I have nothing now upon Earth,” Patty said, with a bigcapital. All that Margaret could do was to accept the situation,thinking many a wistful thought of her poor old uncle, from whomeverything had been taken. Poor Gervase, indeed, had not been much tohis father, but yet he was his son.The winter was long and dreary--dreary enough at Greyshott, where theold gentleman was going daily a step farther down the hill, and oftendreary, too, to Margaret, looking out from the window of her littledrawing-room upon the little row of laurels glistening in the wet, withnow and then a passer-by and his umbrella going heavily by. There aresome people who have an invincible inclination to look out, whatever isoutside the windows, were it only chimney-pots; and Margaret was one ofthese. She got to know every twig of those glistening laurels shining inthe rain, and to recognise even the footsteps that went wading past.There was not much refreshment nor amusement in it, but it was hernature to look out wherever she was. And one afternoon, in the lingeringspring, she suddenly saw a figure coming up the village road which hadnever been seen there before, which seemed to have fallen down from thesky, or risen up from the depths, so little connection had it withanything there. Mrs. Osborne owned the strangeness of the apparitionwith a jump of the heart that had been beating so tranquilly in herbosom. Gerald Piercey here! He had been for a long time abroad,travelling in the East, far out of the usual tracks of travellers, andhad written to her three or four times from desert and distant places,whose names recalled the Arabian Nights to her, but nothing nearer home.The letters had always been curt, and not always amiable: “I note whatyou say about having settled down. If you think the stagnant life of avillage the best thing for you, and your own instructions the bestthing for a boy who will have a part to play in the world, of course itis needless for me to make any remark on the subject.” Margaret receivedthese missives with a little excitement, it must be allowed, if not withpleasure. She confessed to herself that they amused her: “a boy who willhave a part to play in the world!” Did he think, she asked herself witha smile, that Osy was seventeen instead of seven? At seven what did hewant beyond his mother’s instructions? But it cannot be denied thatletters, with curious Turkish hieroglyphics on the address, dated fromDamascus, Baghdad, and other dwellings of the unknown, had an effectupon her. To receive them at Chillfold, in Surrey, was a sensation. TheVicarage children, who collected stamps, were much excited by theTurkish specimens, and she could not help a pleasurable sensation as shebestowed them. Even Osy’s babble about Cousin Colonel was not unpleasingto his mother’s ears. Gerald was far away, unable to take any steps, oreven to say much about Osy. She liked at that distance to have such aman more or less belonging to her. The feeling of opposition had diedaway. He had been fond of Osy, wanted to have him for his own--as whowould not wish to have her beautiful boy?--and what could be moreingratiating to his mother than that sentiment, so long as it wasentertained by a man at Baghdad, who certainly could not take any stepsto steal the boy from his mother? Into this amicable, and even vaguelypleased state of mind she had fallen--when suddenly, without anywarning, without even having seen him come round the corner, GeraldPiercey stood before her eyes.Margaret went away from the window and sat down in the corner by thefire, which was the corner most in the shade and safe from observation.That her heart should beat so was absurd. What was Gerald Piercey toher, or she to Gerald Piercey? He might make what propositions hepleased, but he could not force her to give up her boy. At seven it wasridiculous--out of the question! At seventeen it might be different, butthat was ten long years off. If this was what his object was, was nother answer plain?He came in very gravely, not at all belligerent, though he looked roundwith an air of criticism, remarking the smallness of the place, whichrecalled to some extent Mrs. Osborne’s old feelings towards him. He hadno right to find the cottage small. She thought him looking old, worn,and with care in his face. He, on the other hand, was astonished to seeher so young. The air of Chillfold, the tranquillity and freedom, hadbeen good for Margaret. The desert sun and wind had baked him black andbrown. The quiet of the cottage, the life of a child which she had beenliving, had brought all her early roses back.“I have come,” he said, taking her hand in his, “on a sad errand.” Andthen he paused and cried hurriedly, “What have you done to yourself?Why, you are Meg Piercey again.”“Margaret Osborne at your service,” she said, as she had said before;but with a very different feeling from that which had moved her on theprevious occasion: to be recognised with surprise as young and fair, isa very different thing from being accused angrily of having lost yourfreshness and your youth,--“but what is it, what is it?”“Uncle Giles is dying, Cousin Meg.”“Uncle Giles!” She drew her hand from him and dropped back into herchair. For a moment she did not speak. “But I am not surprised,” shesaid. “I looked for it: how could he go on living with nobody--not oneof his own?”“He might have had you. Poor old man! it is not the time to blame him.”“Me?” said Margaret. “I was not his child; nothing, and nobody, can makeup for the loss of what is your very own.”“Even when it is--Gervase Piercey?”“Poor Gervase!” said Margaret. “Oh, Gerald Piercey, you are a man withwhom things have always gone well. What does it matter what our childrenare? they are our children all the same. And if it were nothing but tothink that it was Gervase--and what poor Gervase was.”Though she was perhaps a little incoherent, Gerald did not object. Hesaid: “At all events, I am very sorry for my poor old uncle. Mrs.Gervase wrote to me to say that he was sinking fast, should I like tocome? and that she was writing to you in the same sense. I had only justarrived when I got her letter, and I thought that the best thing was tocome to you at once, in case you were going to see him.”“Of course, I should wish to go and see him; but I have had no letter. Imust see him if she will let me. Dear old Uncle Giles, he was alwaysgood and fatherly to me.”“And yet he let you leave your home--for this.”“Cousin Gerald,” said Margaret, “don’t let us begin to quarrel again.This is very well--it suits me perfectly--and I am very happy here. Itis my own. My dear old uncle was not strong enough to struggle in myfavour, but he was always kind. I must go to see him, whether she wishesit or not.”“I have a carriage ready. I thought that would be your decision. Weshall get there before dark.”“We?” she said, startled; then added, almost with timidity, “you aregoing----?”“Certainly I am going. You don’t, perhaps, think what this may be to me.My father will be the head of the house----”“And you after him. I fully understand what it is to you,” she said.He gave her a singular look, which she did not at all understand, exceptthat it might mean that with this increased power and authority he wouldhave more to say about Osy. “And to you too,” he said.CHAPTER XLI.Patty received her two visitors without effusion, but with civility. Herdemeanour was very different from all they had known of her before. Shehad been defiant and impertinent, anxious to offend and disgust, ratherthan to attract, with the most anxious desire to get rid of both, and tomake them feel that they had no place nor standing in Greyshott. Shehad, indeed, been so frightened lest she herself should be overthrown,that all the “manners” in which Patty had been brought up deserted her,and she behaved like the barmaid dressed in a little brief and stolenauthority, which they believed her to be. Indeed, the “manners” whichPatty had been taught chiefly consisted in the inculcation of extremerespect to her “betters;” and her revolt from this, and conviction thatshe had now no betters in the world, carried her further in the oppositedirection than if she had had no training at all. But in her calm tenureof authority for nearly a year, Patty had learned many things. She hadlearned that the mistress of a house does not need to stand upon herauthority, and that a right, acknowledged and evident, does not requireto be loudly asserted. It might have been supposed, however, that acertain awe of the heir-at-law--a humility more or less towards the manto whom shortly she must cede her keys, her place, and all the rightsupon which she now stood, would have shown themselves in her. But thiswas not at all the case. She was quite civil to Colonel Piercey, but shetreated him solely as a guest--her guest--without any relationship ofhis own towards the house in which she received him. To Margaret she wasmore friendly, but more careless in her civility. “I ordered them to getready for you the room you used to have. I thought you would probablylike that best,” she said. Colonel Piercey was lodged quite humbly inone of the “bachelor’s rooms,” no special attention of any kind beingpaid to him, which was a thing very surprising to him, though he couldscarcely have told why. To be aware that you are very near being thehead of the house, and to be treated as if you were a very ordinary anddistant relation, is startling in a house which is full of the presenceof death. That presence, when it brings with it no deep family sorrow,brings a sombre business and activity, a sense of suppressedpreparations and watchfulness for the end, which is very painful to thesensitive mind, even when moved by no special feeling. Waiting for anold man to die, it is often difficult not to be impatient for thatevent, as for any other event which involves long waiting. Patty wentabout the house with this air of much business held back and suspendeduntil something should happen. She was called away to have interviewswith this person and that. She spoke of the “arrangements” she had toattend to. “Would it not be better that Colonel Piercey should relieveyou of some part of the trouble?” said Margaret. “Oh, no; one shouldalways do one’s own business. Outsiders never understand,” said Patty,with what would have been, had she been less dignified, a toss of herhead in her widow’s cap.Was Gerald Piercey an outsider in the house that must so soon be hisown? He had given Margaret to understand during their long drive thathis father would not change his home or his life, and that it was he,Gerald, who would occupy Greyshott. I think Colonel Piercey was ofopinion that he had made something else clear, though it had not beenspoken of in words--namely, that there was but one mistress possible forGreyshott in its new life; but Mrs. Osborne did not by any means clearlyunderstand him, having her mind preoccupied by the belief that hisfeelings to her were not of an affectionate kind, and that his firstobject was to deprive her of her child. She felt, however, that he waskind--bewilderingly kind, and that there was something in him whichwanted explanation; but all the more, Margaret was anxious and disturbedby this attitude of “outsider” attributed to him. If Gerald Piercey wasan outsider in Greyshott on the eve of his uncle’s death, to whom he wasnatural heir, who else could have any right there? He did not remarkthis, as was natural. He was not surprised that Patty should hold him atarm’s length. It was quite to be expected that she should feel deeplythe mere fact that he was the heir. Poor girl! He wondered whatprovision had been made for her--if any; and if there should be none,promised himself that his father’s first act, as Sir Francis, should beto set this right. He was, in fact, very sorry for Mrs. Patty, whoseambitions and schemes had come to so summary an end. She should neverrequire to go back to the alehouse, but should be fitly provided for asthe wife of the once heir of Greyshott ought to be. He confided theseintentions to Margaret at the very moment when Mrs. Osborne’s mind wasfull of Patty’s speech about the outsider. “You mean if Uncle Giles hasnot done so already,” Margaret said.“It is very unlikely he should have done so. Of course there could be nosettlement; and who was there to point out to him that such a thing wasnecessary?” Colonel Piercey was so strong in his conviction thatMargaret did not like to suggest even that Patty might herself havepointed it out. But her own mind was full of vague suspicion and alarm.An outsider! Gerald Piercey, the natural heir of the house?Late that night the two visitors were called to Sir Giles’ room. “He isawake and seems to know everybody; I should like you to see him now,”Patty said, going herself to Mrs. Osborne’s room to call her. ColonelPiercey was walking up and down in the hall, with an air of examiningthe old family pictures, which Patty had not thought it necessary tomeddle with, though she had removed those that had been in the library.He was not really looking at them, except as accessories to thescene--silent witnesses of the one that was passing away, and the otherthat was about to come. Gerald Piercey had a deep sadness in his heart,though he could not keep his thoughts from the new life that was beforehim. The very warmth of the rising of that new life and all its hopesmade him feel all the more the deep disappointment and loss in which theother was ending. Poor Gervase would never have been a fitrepresentative of the Pierceys, but as Margaret said, as she had alwayssaid, he was his father’s son, and the object of all the hopes of theold pair who had reigned so long in Greyshott. And now this branch wascut off, their line ended, and the old tree falling that had flourishedso long. He wondered if it would really be any comfort to poor old SirGiles, dying alone in his desolate house, that there were still Pierceysto come after him: the same blood and race, though not drawn from hissource. It seemed questionable how far he would be comforted by this;perhaps not at all, perhaps rather embittered by the fact that it was acousin’s son and not his own, who should now be the head of the house.“Come now, come now,” cried Patty eagerly, “as long as he is soconscious and awake. He sleeps most of his time, and it’s quite achance--quite a chance. I want you to see with your own eyes that he’sall himself, and has his faculties still.” She had an air of excitementabout her perhaps not quite appropriate to the moment, as if her nerveswere all in motion, and she could scarcely keep her fingers still orsubdue the quiver in her head and over all her frame. She led the wayhurriedly, opening the doors one after another in an excited way, andpushing into the sick room with a “Look, dear papa, who I’ve brought tosee you.” Sir Giles was sitting up in his bed, his large ashy faceturned towards the door, his dim sunken eyes looking out from fold uponfold of heavy eyelid, his under-lip hanging as that of poor Gervase haddone. “Ah,” he stammered, “let ’em come in--to the light, my dear. I’mnot in a state--to see strangers; but to please you--my dear.”“Uncle Giles,” said Margaret, with an exclamation of pain, “surely youknow me?”“Eh? let her stand--in the light--in the light; why, why, why--Meg: it’sMeg,--that’s Meg.” She kissed him, and he made an effort to turn hisfeeble head, and with his large moist lips he gave a tremulous kiss inthe air. “I’m--I’m glad to see you, Meg. You were the first to--tellme--to tell me: I’ll be always grateful to you--for that.”“For what, dear uncle? It is I who owe everything to you. Oh, UncleGiles, if I could only tell you how much and how often I think of it!you were always kind, always kind; and dear Aunt Piercey; you gave me myhome, the only home I ever had.”“Eh! eh! What is she saying, my dear? You’ll--you’ll look afterMeg--never let her come to want. She was the first to tell me. Thegreatest news that has come--to Greyshott. You remember, Meg--and Osy,bless him, how he cheered! There’s--there’s something for Osy. Hecheered like a little trump, and he gave--he gave my boy his onlywedding present, the--the only one. Dunning, where is my purse? Osy musthave a tip--two tips for that.”“Dear papa,” cried Patty, “don’t disturb yourself; oh, don’t disturbyourself! I’ll see to it.”“My--my purse, Dunning!” The purse was procured while they all stood by,and the old man fumbling, got with difficulty, one after another, twosovereigns, which fell out of his trembling fingers upon the bed. “Onefor--for cheering; and one for--for the other thing. Give ’em to Osy,Meg, bless him; and my blessing. When It comes and all’s right, that’llbe a friend for Osy--always a friend, better than an old man.”“Dear papa,” cried Patty, pushing forward again, “here is some one elseto see you--Colonel Piercey, dear, don’t you remember? ColonelPiercey--Gerald--that once paid you a long visit; I know you’ll rememberif you try. Here,” she said, seizing his arm, pulling him forward,“stand in the light that he may see you.”She was vibrating with excitement like a creature on wires. The touch ofher hand on Gerald’s arm was like an electric cord; and to be pushedforward thus, and accounted for as if he had been an absolute stranger,to be brought with difficulty to the mind of the dying man, was toGerald Piercey, as may well be supposed, an insupportable sensation. Hedrew back, saying hastily, “I cannot disturb him. I will not have himdisturbed for me--let him alone, let him alone.”“Eh? what? who’s that? somebody else? Gerald?” said Sir Giles. He heldout his hand vaguely into the air, not seeing where his attention wascalled, the large old limp grey hand, with so little volition or powerleft in it. “Ah, Gerald, come to see the end of the old man? that’skind! that’s kind! My poor wife and I used to think if our first boy hadlived, don’t you know, he might have been a man like you. Well, Gerald,I’ve nothing to give you, but my blessing--but my blessing. You won’tmind if your nose is put out of joint, you know, as the old folks say.And you’ll stand by It, Gerald, a--a good fellow like you.”“Dear papa, I think they’ll go now; it’s late, and you ought to go tosleep.”“Not yet,” said Sir Giles, who had fallen into the old strain of faintsobbing and laughing; “plenty--plenty of time for sleep. Thousands ofyears, don’t you know, till it’s all--all over. Where are they? eh, Meg.I scarcely see you; eh!” he kissed the air again with his hanging,lifeless lips, “good-night; and t’other man. Gerald, be kind to her, myboy; a good girl, Meg, a good girl. She’s been married, which some mightthink a drawback; but if you’re fond of her, and she’s fond of you. Eh,Dunning? well I’m not tired, not tired a bit--let him be the god-father,my dear; and good-night to you, good-night to you--all.”He died in the night.The third funeral within a year from Greyshott! What a melancholy recordwas that--father and mother, and the only child! Sir Giles was the onlyone of the three who could be said to have been beloved. His wife hadalways been an imperious woman, his son had been a fool; but the old manwas full of gentleness and kindness, and had been a model countrygentleman in his day, known to everybody, and always genial to rich andpoor. Once more the avenue was full of carriages, and the house ofmourners, and there were some tears, and many kind recollections, and agreat deal of talk about him as they carried him away. “It will be along time before we see the like of him again,” the country folk andtenants said, while the gentlemen of the county congratulated themselvesthat the old name was not to be extinct nor the land transferred toother hands. The new baronet was not there; he was also an old man, andnot fond of much movement, but Colonel Piercey was his representative,and an excellent representative, a man of whom the whole district mightbe proud. He was looked to by every one, pointed out to those who didnot know him, and surrounded by a subtle atmosphere of suspendedcongratulation and welcome, notwithstanding the universal grief for SirGiles. The old man’s dying words had not made a very deep impression onColonel Piercey, except those which concerned Margaret. He had notunderstood the allusions, nor indeed thought of them, save as thewanderings of weakness. It seemed all of a piece to him--the thoughtthat Sir Giles’ firstborn, the boy dead some thirty years ago, mighthave grown such a man as he, and his nose being put out of joint, andthe petition that he should be good to some one, and stand by it. Allthese wild and wandering words Gerald Piercey put out of his head asmeaning nothing. It was, perhaps, the “first boy,” whom he had neverheard of before, whom he was to be good to, yet who would put his noseout of joint. It was all a muddle, and Gerald did not attempt to gropehis way through it. He was deeply impressed and touched by the image ofthe old man dying; but he had no doubt as to his own prospects, andthought of no disaster. How could there be any doubt? If there had beena new will made since the death of Gervase, no doubt the estate had beencharged with an adequate provision for Gervase’s wife; if there had beenno will made, his father and he, as the next-of-kin and heir-at-law,would of course take that into their own hands, and secure it at once.Beyond this and the natural legacies, Gerald suspected no new thing.Margaret, on the other hand, had been deeply alarmed and startled bywhat she heard. She did not remember what she had said on the occasionto which her uncle referred, but she remembered his outburst ofcheering, and Osy, with his legs wide apart and his hat waving in hishand, giving forth his hip, hip, hurrah. Was it possible that the oldman had made out to himself some fiction of what might be going tohappen, some illusion which buoyed him up with false hopes? Was itpossible that Patty----? Margaret did not know what to think. She wouldfain have confided her alarm to Gerald, and taken counsel with him; butthose other words of Sir Giles had been too broadly significant, and hewas the last person in the world to whom she could talk on any subjectthat would recall them. She had avoided Gerald, indeed, since thatscene, and it had not been referred to again between them. But her mindwas full of perplexity and doubt. The bearing of Patty (always _digne_,always just what a daughter-in-law’s chastened grief should be,--not toodemonstrative), so confident, so authoritative, so determined to doeverything herself, without assistance from an “outsider,” increasedthis sensation of alarm and uncertainty in Margaret’s mind. She did notknow in the least what was coming. But it seemed to her certain thatsomething was coming which was not in the course of nature, or accordingto the common expectation. Her mind grew more and more confused, yetmore and more certain of this as the crisis approached; for Patty neverhad been so independent, so confident, so sure of being the head ofeverything, as on the funeral day.Yet Patty had her troubles, too, which she had to bear alone, andwithout any aid at this crisis of her career. Miss Hewitt, whoseindignation at her reception on her first visit had been so great thatshe had made a vow never to see her ungrateful niece again, had, by thetime that Sir Giles’ dangerous condition had become publicly known, gotover her fury. She had been paid her fifty pounds, and she had begun tobelieve in Patty’s continued success and in her cleverness and power.There had been a pause of alarm in the family after the death ofGervase, when they had all feared (little knowing her spirit) that Pattywould be sent back on their hands. But when that alarm was well over andPatty was found to hold her own, the admiration of her relations wasdoubled. Her father was the first to claim a renewal of friendship; buthis reception was so alarming, and his daughter poured forth upon hishead such torrents of wrath, telling him that, but for the exposure offamily affairs, she would have him tried for manslaughter, that thelandlord of the Seven Thorns slunk off completely cowed and without aword to say. This added to Miss Hewitt’s regard for her brave andvictorious niece, who feared no one, and she had in the meantime mademany attempts to obtain a footing at Greyshott. Partly to impress stillmore sensibly upon her father her utter and unchangeable hostility, andpartly because some one to speak to became a necessity, Patty hadadmitted her aunt on various occasions; and now Miss Hewitt demanded,with a persistence which all Patty’s spare moments had been spent inresisting, first an interview with Sir Giles, and then a place in thecarriage which conveyed her niece to his funeral. Patty had not yieldedin respect to the first, but in the extreme state of mental excitementin which she was, her resolution gave way before the second prayer. Ithad not been her intention to “mix herself up with any of the Hewitts,”but in face of the scene which she anticipated at the reading of thewill, it gradually came to appear more and more desirable to her to havesome one to stand by her, some one to be dazzled by her position andgood fortune, and to take her part whatever opposition she might meetwith. Patty did not know what might happen at the reading of the will.She had a prevision, but not even now any absolute certainty, what thewill was. And if it were as she believed, she did not know what powersmight be brought into action against her, or what might be done. Shedecided at last that to have her aunt, who at bottom was a thoroughlycongenial spirit, to defend and stand by her, would be an advantage. Andthis was how it was that Miss Hewitt attained the lugubrious triumph ofher life, the satisfaction of following her former lover in his oldcarriage, his wife’s carriage, whom she considered her triumphant rival,to his grave.CHAPTER XLII.It was a strange triumph, and yet it was one. Miss Hewitt closelyfollowed her niece, once more wrapt in a new extravagance of crape; andthese ladies had the satisfaction of seeing Mrs. Osborne quietly takeher place opposite to them on the front seat of the carriage. This gaveboth to Patty and her aunt an acute sensation of pleasure, which wouldhave been greater, however, had the victim seemed in any way consciousof it. But Margaret was full of many thoughts, recollections, andanticipations. She, too, looked forward to the disclosure of her uncle’swill with a curiosity and anxiety which had nothing to do with anyexpectations of her own. She had put away the two sovereigns sotremulously extracted from his purse by the dying man with a half smileand a tear. That, she concluded, was all that Osy would ever have fromhis great-uncle, who might so easily have made a provision for the boy.She had never expected it, she said to herself, but that was a differentthing from this certainty that it never would be; still there was atender familiarity about the “tip” for the child which went toMargaret’s heart. Poor old uncle! If he had been left to himself, if hehad been able to think, he would have acted differently. She put awaythe two pieces of money for Osy without any grudge, with a tenderthought of the old man who had been as good as a father to her all herlife. And now was this the end of Greyshott so far as she was concerned?or was there a strange something looming out of the clouds, another lifeof which she would not think, which she could not understand, to whichshe did not consent? She put all thought out of her mind of anythingthat concerned herself, or tried her best to do so--but the family wasdear to her still. Was there any plot threatening the name, the race,the old, old dwelling of the Pierceys? There was a subdued triumph inPatty’s look, a confidence in her voice and step, and the authoritativeorders she gave, which did not look like a woman who after to-day wouldhave no real authority in Sir Francis Pierce’s house. She could notimagine what it could mean; but the advent of the elder woman, also incrape, and full of ostentatious sympathy and regret, strengthened allher apprehensions, though she did not know of what she was afraid.One or two of the oldest friends remained for the reading of the will.It was felt on all sides that the grief which attended Sir Giles to histomb was of a modified kind. No one except Mrs. Osborne could besupposed to regard the old gentleman with filial love or sorrow, and theparty which assembled round the luncheon table was serious, but put onno affectation of woe. Patty took her place at the head of the tablewith a quiet assurance to which nobody objected. She had too much senseto talk of “dear papa” before all these people, and if she showed thecomposure of an authorised and permanent mistress of the house, it wasprobably because she had been accustomed to do so. Lord Hartmore, if hissympathies were not so much aroused as on the day of Gervase’s funeral,still retained a sort of partisan feeling for the young widow. She washis _protégée_. His wife had not fallen in with his views, except in themost moderate way, merely to honour the promise he had made for her.Lady Hartmore did not attempt to improve her acquaintance with Patty.She was quite at her ease at the other end of the table by the side ofColonel Piercey, who now was _de facto_, in her assured belief, themaster of the house. Margaret was not present at the luncheon, and MissHewitt, who was elated beyond expression by finding herself seated amongall the great people, on the other side of Lord Hartmore, felt herselfthe principal person at table, and demeaned herself accordingly. “Tothink,” she said, “my lord, that I should find myself ’ere on such anoccasion; me that once thought to be the mistress; but oh! the ideas ofthe young is different from what comes to pass in life. ’Im as we havelaid in his grave, dear gentleman, was once---- Well, Patty, love, asyou say, this ain’t a time to talk of such things. Still, it do comeupon me sitting at ’is table, and ’im not ’ere to bid me welcome. Butit’s a mournful satisfaction to see the last of ’im all the same.”“Aunt was an old friend of my dear father-in-law,” Patty explained,curtly. “I believe, Lord Hartmore, that you know more of MargaretOsborne than I do. Margaret Osborne has not shown very much sympathy tome, and all this winter I have never been able to get out for such apurpose as making calls. I couldn’t have taken a three hours’ drive tobe away so long, not if it had been a matter of life and death. Thatmeans almost a whole day, and dear Sir Giles never liked to let me outof his sight.”“Ah, ’e always knew them that were really fond of ’im,” said MissHewitt. “You couldn’t blind ’im, my lord, with pretences. I was kep’back by my family, and thoughts of what the world might say; but ’e knewthat Patty was the same stuff like, and ’e took to her the double ofwhat ’e would have done on that account. Oh, your lordship, what a man’e was! You’re too young to remember ’im at ’is best: ’andsome is as’andsome does, folk say--but a gentleman like ’im can’t always act as ’ewould like to. You must know that from yourself, my lord. Sometimes the’eart don’t go where the ’and ’as to be given.”“Well, that is certainly sometimes the case,” said Lord Hartmore, with asubdued laugh, “though I don’t think I know it by myself.”“Aunt’s so full of her old times,” cried Patty. “If there was anythingthat was ever wanted for the little Osborne boy, Lord Hartmore, Ishould always be pleased to help. He got too much for my dearfather-in-law latterly, being noisy, and such a spoiled little thing;but he was fond of him, and spoke of him at the very last.” “I can neverforget that,” said Patty, putting her handkerchief lightly to her eyes.“And if there should be need of a little help for his education, orsetting him out in life--but I should have a delicacy in saying so toMargaret Osborne, unless you’d be so good as to do it for me.”“Oh, you’re very kind, Mrs. Piercey,” said Lord Hartmore, confused. “Ourdear Meg is rather a formidable person to approach with such aproposal.”“Yes, isn’t she formidable?” cried Patty, eagerly. “That’s just theword; one is frightened to offer to do her a good turn.”“Let us hope,” said Lord Hartmore, “that her good uncle has left herbeyond the need of help.”“Oh, I don’t know about that,” said Patty, with a very serious face.“I feel sure of it,” said Lord Hartmore, with genial confidence. “He wasfar too good a man, and too kind an uncle. Mrs. Piercey, I see my friendGerald looking this way, and Mr. Pownceby wriggling in his chair, asif----” He made a slight movement as if to rise--which perhaps was notthe highest breeding in Lord Hartmore; but it was very slight andaccompanied by a look of deference, suggesting a signal on her part.“Mr. Gerald Piercey is not master here, nor is Mr. Pownceby,” saidPatty, with dignity. “They may look as they please, but in my own houseit’s my part to say when people are to leave the table.”“She do have a spirit, Patty does,” Miss Hewitt murmured under herbreath.Lord Hartmore settled himself in his chair again, abashed. “I beg yourpardon,” he said; and then, in a subdued tone, “Most likely Pownceby hasa train to catch.”“In that case I don’t mind stretching a point,” said the lady of thehouse, “though Mr. Pownceby is no more than a hired servant paid for histime, and it is no business of his to interfere.”A hired servant! Old Pownceby, who had all the secrets of the county inhis hands, and most of its business! Lord Hartmore grew pale with awe atthis daring speech. He looked straight before him, not to see thesignals of his wife telegraphing to him from Gerald Piercey’s side.“I’ll have nothing to do with it,” he said to himself; and, indeed, inhis consternation, Lord Hartmore was the last to get up when themovement of the chairs convinced him that Mrs. Piercey had condescendedto move. He offered that lady his arm humbly, on an indication from herthat this was expected. “I suppose we shall see Mrs. Osborne in thelibrary?” he said.“Oh, Margaret! I suppose she’d better be there for form’s sake, though Idon’t suppose it matters much. Aunt, will you tell Margaret Osborne tocome directly, please? I have never,” said Patty, with a smile, “gotinto the way of calling her Meg, as you all do.”Lord Hartmore could scarcely dissimulate the little start ofconsternation with which he heard this. The forlorn young widow, forwhom he had been so sorry, was appearing in a new light; but, of course,it was only her ignorance, he said to himself. The party had allassembled in the library when the voice of Miss Hewitt was heard outsidecalling to some one who seemed to be following: “This way,Margaret--this way. They’re all in the library. I don’t know the ’ouseso well as I might, but this is the way. Come along please, quick, anddon’t keep the company waiting,” Miss Hewitt said.Gerald Piercey started forward to open the door, for which Miss Hewittrewarded him with an “Oh! thank you, but I’m quite at ’ome, quite at’ome.” Margaret came in in the wake of that bustling figure, pale, andwith an air of suspense. “Was it necessary to send for me in that way?”she said to Gerald. He had placed a chair for her beside Lady Hartmore.“Oh, Heaven knows what is necessary!” said that lady. “You know theproverb about beggars on horseback.” She was not so careful to subdueher voice as she might have been, but in the commotion it was notobserved. Gerald Piercey stood with his hand on the back of his cousin’schair. They were the family, the only persons present of the Pierceyblood. The old friends of the house stood near them. At the upper end ofthe room were Patty and her aunt. Mr. Pownceby stood in front of thelarge fireplace with a paper in his hand.“I must explain,” he said, “how the will I have to read is so verysuccinct a document. Sir Giles had made his will like other men, and asthere was a good deal to leave, there were a number of bequests. Thelate Mr. Gervase Piercey was, of course, the heir, under trustees, as hewas not much--acquainted with business. Sir Giles thought fit to changethis, as was to be expected, after his son’s death. He sent for mehastily one day, and gave me instructions which surprised me. I beggedhim to allow me to take these back with me in order that the new willshould be properly written out, proposing to come back next day toexecute it, and, in short, hoping that he might reconsider the matter;but he would hear of no delay. This document I will now read.”Gerald Piercey stood quite undisturbed, with his hand on the back ofMargaret’s chair. He was not anxious. It had not occurred to him thatthe house of his fathers could be alienated from him, and short of that,his poor old uncle’s wishes would, he sincerely felt, be sacred whateverthey were. He was glad to hear that there was a new will made, which, nodoubt, provided for Mrs. Piercey; and waited with an easy mind to hearwhat it was. As for Margaret, the event about to happen began to dawnclearly upon her. She saw it in Patty’s eyes, in her pose, sitting updefiant in Lady Piercey’s chair. She looked up at her cousin with aneager desire to warn him, to support him, but was daunted by the calmof his look, fearing no evil. “Gerald, Gerald,” she said, instinctively.The lines of his face melted suddenly; he looked down upon her with anencouraging, protecting smile, and took her hand for a moment, saying“Meg!” and no more. He thought she was appealing to him for his care andprotection in face of a probable disappointment to herself.Mr. Pownceby cleared his throat and waved his hand. He ran over theexordium, name, and formula, of sound mind, etc., etc., to whicheverybody listened impatiently, “do give and bequeath the whole of myestates, property, real and personal, etc., to----” here he paused alittle, as if his own throat were dry--“Patience Piercey, mydaughter-in-law, and companion for the last six months, to be at herentire disposal as it may be best for the interests of the family, andin remainder to her child. This I do, believing it to be best formeeting all difficulties, and in view of any contingency that mightarise.“Signed, Giles Piercey,” added the lawyer, “and dated Greyshott, 16thJune, just a fortnight ago.”There was a pause. Even now it did not seem to have struck ColonelPiercey what it meant. He listened with a half smile. “And----?” hesaid, waiting as if for more.“That is all, Colonel Piercey, every word. The house, estates, money,everything. Even the servants are cut out. He said she’d look afterthem. Mrs. Piercey takes everything--house, lands, money, plate,everything. It is a very unusual and surprising will, but that is all.”And then there was another pause, and a general deep-drawn breath.“It is a very surprising will indeed,” said Lord Hartmore.It was a sort of remark to himself, forced from him by the astonishmentof the moment; but in the silence of the room it sounded as if addressedlike an oration to all who were there.“Pardon me,” cried Colonel Piercey, “but Greyshott? Do you mean thatGreyshott, the original home of the family----?”“I represented that to Sir Giles, but he would hear nothing. It is Mrs.Piercey’s with all the rest.”“It is the most iniquitous thing I ever heard,” cried Lady Hartmore,rising quickly to her feet. “What! not a word of anybody belonging tohim, nothing of Meg and her boy, nothing of his natural heirs, nothingof old Dunning even, and the old servants?--The man must have been mad.”Here Patty rose and advanced to the conflict. She was very nervous, butcollected. “Mr. Pownceby can bear me witness that I knew nothing aboutit,” she said. “I wasn’t there.”“No, you were not there,” said the lawyer.“I thought it right I should have a provision,” said Patty, “and so itwas right; and if my dear father-in-law thought that the one that stoodby him, and nursed him through all his illness, when everybody elseforsook him, was the one that ought to have it, who’s got anything tosay against that? I didn’t want it; but now that I’ve got it, I’ll stickto it,” cried Patty defiantly, confronting Lady Hartmore, who had beenthe only one to speak.“I have no doubt of it,” cried that lady, “but if I were ColonelPiercey, I shouldn’t stand it; no, not for a moment! Why, the old manwas in his dotage, no more equal to making a will than---- than his sonwould have been.”“Mary!” cried her husband in dismay.“Well!” said Lady Hartmore, suddenly brought to herself by theconsciousness of having said more than she ought to have said, “I amglad, I am quite glad, Hartmore, for one thing, that you’ll now seethings in their proper light.”“And a very just will, too,” cried Miss Hewitt, coming to her niece’sside,--“just like ’im, as was a very right-thinking man. Patty was anangel to ’im, that she was, night and day. And it is nothing but whatwas to be expected, that ’e should give ’er all as ’e had to give. Andnot too much, neither, to the only one as nursed ’im, and did for ’im,and gave up everything. Oh! I always said it--’e was a right-thinkingman.”Colonel Piercey said nothing after that exclamation of “Greyshott!” buthe retired with the lawyer into a corner as soon as the spell ofconsternation was broken by the sudden sound of these passionate voices.He had seized Margaret by the arm and drawn her with him. “We are therepresentatives of the family,” he said, hurriedly; and Mrs. Osborne wastoo much startled (though she had foreseen it), too sympathetic, and toomuch excited, to object to the manner in which he had drawn her handwithin his arm. “Our interests are the same,” he said, briefly, with ahurried nod to Mr. Pownceby; and they stood talking for some minutes,while a wonderful interchange of artillery went on behind. This wasconcluded by a sudden clear sound of Patty’s voice in the air, ringingwith passion and mastery. “I believe,” she said, “Lord Hartmore’scarriage is at the door.” And then there arose a laugh of sharp angerfrom the other side. “We are turned out,” cried Lady Hartmore, “turnedout of Greyshott, where we were familiar before that chit was born.” Itwas a little like scolding, but it was the voice of nature all the same.“And I think,” said Colonel Piercey, “Meg, that you and I had better go,too.”“Oh, as you please!” cried Patty; “Meg can stay if she likes, and I’vealready said I shouldn’t mind giving any reasonable help to educate thelittle boy. And as for you, Gerald Piercey, you can do what you like,and I can see you are bursting with envy. You can’t touch me!”CHAPTER XLIII.It was thus in wrath and in consternation that the party dispersed.Patty stood in the hall, flushed and fierce, with defiance in everylook, supported by her aunt, who stood behind her, and gave vent fromtime to time to murmurs of sympathy and snorts of indignation. Patty hadalmost forgotten, in her mingled triumph and rage, the anxiouslychastened demeanour which she had of late imposed upon herself. She wasa great deal more like Patty of the Seven Thorns than she had ever beensince her marriage. The opposition and scorn of Lady Hartmore hadawakened all her combative tendencies, and made her for the momentcareless of consequences. What did she care for those big wigs wholooked down upon her? Was she not as good as any of them, herself acounty magnate, the lady of Greyshott? better than they were! For theHartmores were not so rich as comported with their dignity; and Pattywas now rich, to her own idea enormously rich, and as great a lady asany in England. Was she not Mrs. Piercey of Greyshott, owning nosuperior anywhere? It is curious that this conviction should have sweptaway for the moment all her precautions of behaviour, and restored herto the native level of the country barmaid, as ready to scold as anyfishwife, to defy every rule of respect or even politeness. She waitedto see Lady Hartmore to the door, having swept out of the room beforethat astonished lady with a bosom bursting with rage. Truth to tell,Lady Hartmore was much disposed to fight, too. She would have liked,above all things, to give the little upstart what humbler persons call apiece of her mind. Her pulses, too, were beating high, and a flood ofwords were pressing to her lips. It was intolerable to her to accept theinsult to herself and the wrong to her friends without sayinganything--without laying the offender low under the tempest of herwrath. As for Lord Hartmore, it must be owned that he was frightened,and only anxious to get his wife away. He held her arm tightly in his,and gave it an additional pressure as he led her past the fierce littleadversary who, no doubt, had a greater command of appropriate languagethan even Lady Hartmore had, whose style was probably less trenchant,though more refined. “Now, Mary, now, my dear,” he said soothingly. Thesight of the carriage at the door was delightful to him as a safe portto a sailor. And though the first thing Lady Hartmore did when safelyensconced in her corner, was to turn upon him the flood of hersuppressed wrath with a “So this is your interesting little widow,Hartmore!” he was too glad to get away from the sphere of combat toattempt any self-defence. He, too, was saying “the little demon!” underhis breath.Patty still stood there, when Margaret, who had hastily collected thefew things she had brought with her, came down to join Colonel Pierceyin the hall. He had been standing, as he had been on a previousoccasion, carefully examining one of the old portraits. It was not avery interesting portrait, nor was he, I suppose, specially interestedin it; but his figure, wrapt in silence and abstraction, made a curiouscontrast to that of Patty, thrilling with fire and movement. It wasevident that she could not long restrain herself, and when Margaretappeared coming down the great stairs, the torrent burst forth.“Oh, you are there, Meg Osborne: I wonder you didn’t go with your greatfriends, the first people in the county, as you all think, insulting mein my own house! Ah, and I’ll teach you all it’s my own house! I won’thave nobody here turning their backs to me, or going out and in of myplace without as much as a thank you! You’re studying my pictures,Colonel Piercey, are you? They’re my pictures, they’re not yours; andI’ll have you to know that nobody sha’n’t even look at them without myconsent.”Colonel Piercey turned round, almost angry with himself for the fury hefelt. “I beg your pardon,” he said, very gravely, yet with a sort ofsmile.“Oh, you beg my pardon! and you laugh as if it were a joke! I can tellyou it’s no joke. They’re all mine, willed by him as knew best who hewanted them to go to; and I’ll keep them, that I will, against all thebeggarly kinsfolk in the world; coming here a-looking as soon as the oldman’s in his grave for what they can devour!”“Are you ready, Margaret?” Colonel Piercey said.“Don’t you turn it off to her, sir: speak to me! It’s me that has to beconsidered first. You are going off mighty high: no civility to the headof the house, though I’ve taken you in and given you lodging in myhouse, at least Meg there, near a week? Oh, you laugh again, do you? Andwho is the head of the house if it’s not me? I’m Mrs. Piercey ofGreyshott. The pictures are mine, and the name’s mine, as well aseverything else; and you are nothing but the son of the younger brother,and not got as much to do with it as Pownceby there, the lawyer.”“My dear Mrs. Piercey,” said Mr. Pownceby, “however much you may despisePownceby the lawyer, he knows a little more on that subject than you do:a lady is rarely, if ever, the head of a house, and certainly never onewho belongs to the family only by marriage. One word, if you please:Colonel Piercey’s father, now Sir Francis Piercey, is the undoubted headof the house.”“Oh, you’ll say anything, of course, to back them up; you think they’reyour only friends and will pay you best. But you’ll find that’s amistake, Mr. Pownceby the lawyer, just as they’ll find it’s a mistake.What do you want here, Dunning? What business has servants, except myfootman to open the door, here? You’ve been a deal too much petted inyour time, and you’ll find out the difference now.”“Mr. Pownceby, sir,” said Dunning, who had suddenly appeared on thescene, exceedingly dark and lowering, “Is it true, sir, what I hear,that none of us old servants, not me, sir, that looked after him nightand day, is named in my old master’s will?”“I am sorry to say it is quite true, Dunning,” Mr. Pownceby said; “but Idon’t doubt that Mrs. Piercey will remember your long service, as SirGiles wished her to do.”“How do you know what Sir Giles wished? I know best what Sir Giles saidI was to do,” cried Patty. “As for long service, yes, if holding on likegrim death and taking as little trouble as possible is what you mean.”“Me take little trouble!” cried Dunning, foaming. “I’ve not had anight’s rest, not an unbroken night, since Lady Piercey died--not one.Oh, I knowed how it would be! when she come about him, flattering himand slavering him, and the poor dear old gentleman thought it was goodfor Mr. Gervase; and then after, didn’t she put it upon him as she wasin the family-way, and she never was in the family-way, no more than Iwas. Hoh! ask the women! Hoh! look at her where she stands! He thoughtas there was an heir coming, and there ain’t no more of an heir comingthan----”“Let us go, please, let us go,” cried Margaret, in distress. “CousinGerald, Mr. Pownceby, we have nothing, nothing surely, to do with this.Oh, let us get away.”“Put that fellow out of my house!” cried Patty, “put him out of myhouse! You’re a nice gentleman, Gerald Piercey, to stand there andencourage a man like that to insult a lady. Robert, take that man by theshoulders and put him out.”“He had just best try,” said Dunning, squaring his shoulders. ButRobert, who was young and slim, knew better than to try. He stoodsheepishly fumbling by the door, opening it for the party who were goingout. Dunning was not an adversary to be lightly encountered. ColonelPiercey, however, not insensible to the appeal made to him, laid hishand on Dunning’s shoulder.“This lady is right,” he said; “we must not insult a woman, Dunning. Youhad better come with us in the meantime. It will do you no good to stayhere.”“Ah, go with them and plot, do,” cried Patty; “I knew that’s how itwould end. He knows I can expose him and all his ways--neglecting mydear old father-in-law; he knows he’ll never get another place if peoplehear what I’ve got to say of him! Oh, yes, go with ’em, do! They thoughtthey were to have it all their own way, and turn me out. But all of you,every one, will just learn the difference. If he had behaved like agentleman and her like a lady, I might have given them their old rubbishof pictures. I don’t care for that trash; they’re no ornament to theplace. I intend to have them all taken down and carted off to the firstauction there is anywhere. I don’t believe they’d bring above a fewshillings; but all the same they are mine, and I’ll have no strangersmeddling with them,” Patty cried. “Oh, for goodness’ sake, AuntPatience, hold your tongue, and let me manage my affairs myself.”“The only thing is just this, ladies and gentlemen,” said Miss Hewitt.“She’s got put out, poor thing, and I don’t wonder, seeing all as she’s’ad to do; but she don’t mean more than a bit of temper, and she’ll sooncome round if you’ll have a little patience. This is the gentleman thatcome to me, and that I first told as my niece was married to GervasePiercey, and no mistake. ’E is a very civil gentleman, Patty, and, Lord,why should you go and make enemies of ’im and of this lady, as I shouldsay was a-going to be ’_is_ good lady, and both belonging to the family!Nor I would not go and make an enemy of Mr. Pownceby, as ’as all thefamily papers in his ’ands and knows a deal, and could be of such use toyou. I’d ask them all to stay, if I was you, to a nice bit of familydinner, and talk things over. What _is_ the good of making enemies whenbeing friends would be so much more use to you?” said Miss Hewitt, withtriumphant logic. But Patty, who had heard with impatience and manyattempts to interrupt, turned away before her oration was over, and,turning her back upon her recent guests, walked away as majestically aswas possible, with her long train sweeping over the carpet, to thedrawing-room, where she shut herself in, slamming the door. Miss Hewittthrew up her hands and eyes. “That’s just ’er,” she cried, “just ’er!Thinks of nothing when ’er temper’s up; but I ’ope you won’t thinknothing of it neither. She’ll be as good friends in a hour as if nothinghad ’appened; and I’ll go and give her a good talking to,” the auntsaid.When Miss Hewitt reached the drawing-room she found Patty thrown uponthe sofa in the second stage of her passion, which was, naturally,tears. But these paroxysms did not last long. “I let you talk, AuntPatience,” she said. “It pleased you, and it looked well enough. But Iknow my affairs better than you. Enemies! of course they’re all myenemies, and I don’t blame them. What I said I said on purpose, not in atemper. I had them here on purpose to see the old gentleman before hedied, so that they might know for themselves that he was in his rightmind, and all that; and old Pownceby knows; and I wanted to show themthat I wasn’t afraid of them, not a bit. However, that’s all over, andyou needn’t trouble your head about it. I have a deal to do before thetrial----”“The trial!” said Miss Hewitt, in consternation. “Is there going to be atrial?”“Of course there will be a trial. They won’t let Greyshott go without atry for it, and you’ll see me in all the papers, and the whole story,and I don’t know that there’s anything to be ashamed of. The thing I’vegot to find out now is who to have for my lawyers. I want to have thebest--the very best; and some one that will make it all into a story,and tell all I did for the poor old man. I was good to him,” saidPatty, with an admiration of herself which was very genuine--“I wasindeed. Many a time I’ve wanted to get a little pleasure like otherfolks--to enjoy myself a bit. Oh, there was one night! when RogerPearson was here and had been at a dance, and I knew all the girls wereat it, and all as jolly as----, and me cooped up, playing backgammonwith the old gentleman, and--and worse beside.”“Good Lord, Patty!” cried Miss Hewitt. “Roger Pearson! where ever didyou see Roger Pearson? I thought _that_ was all over and done with!”“What did you please to mean by that remark?” said Patty, with greatdignity. “It doesn’t matter where I saw him. I did see him; and there’snot many girls would have gone on with the backgammon and--the rest, asI did, just that night. Aunt Patience, you may know a few things, butyou don’t know the trials of a married woman.”“The trials!” said Miss Hewitt. “I’ve known a many that have boasted ofthe advantage it was. But trials--no. You’ll be very willing, Ishouldn’t wonder, to have ’em again.”“That depends upon many things; but I think not,” said Patty.“You mightn’t be lucky the first time, and yet be lucky the second,”said her aunt; “but it can’t be said to be unlucky, Patty, when itleaves you here, not twenty-five yet, with this grand property all toyourself. Lord! I thought you was lucky at the first, when you got ’im;for I knew they couldn’t put ’im out of ’is rights, Softy or no Softy;but just think the luck you’ve had since; ’is mother dead afore you comehome, and that was a blessing, and then ’imself just a blessed release,and then----”“I’ll thank you, Aunt Patience, not to speak of my husband in that way.A release! Who’d have dared to say a word if Gervase had been here? Oh!”she said, springing up from her seat, and stamping her foot upon thecarpet, “and here I am for ever and ever just what I am now, when Iwould have been my lady all my life, and nobody to stop me, if he hadlived but six months more!”“Dear, and that’s true,” said Miss Hewitt deeply struck with the tragedyof the event. “I do pity you, my pet! my poor darling! That’s true,that’s true!”While this scene was going on in Greyshott, Gerald and Margaret werejogging on towards Chillfold in their hired chaise. They had a greatdeal to say, and yet there were long silences between them. Gerald wasmore angry, Margaret more sad.“I should have minded nothing else,” the Colonel said, “if he had keptthe old house for us, the house that has produced us all--Greyshott,that has never belonged but to a Piercey; and, Meg, if he had donejustice to you.”“There was no justice owing to me,” she said. “I left the house at myown free will. I belong to another house and another name----”“That might have been true,” said Colonel Piercey, with something of hisold stiffness and severity, “if----”“It is true,” she said, “I am of the family of my child.”“Oh,” he cried, “what folly, at your age! I was angry to have lost you;but now, I can’t tell how it is, you are Meg Piercey again.”“You have got used to my changed looks,” she said. “You have acceptedthe fact that I am no longer in my teens. But this is not worthdiscussing when there is so much more to think of. What shall you do?or, indeed, what can you do?”“Fight it, certainly,” he said. “As soon as I have taken you home, I amto meet old Pownceby, and lay the whole case before the best man we canget. Thank Heaven, I am not without means to fight it out. Poor UncleGiles! It is hard to call him up to a reckoning before all the world;but he could not have meant it; he could never have meant it.”“I have his little tip for Osy,” said Margaret, with tears in her eyes.“His little tip! when he ought to have provided for the boy!”“Poor Uncle Giles! He was never very strong: and I believe she was verykind to him, and he was fond of her.”“Do you want me to accept this absurd will, this loss to the race,because she was kind to him (granting that)--and an old man, in hisdotage, was fond of a scheming woman?”“Don’t call names,” said Margaret. “He was not in his dotage. We sawhim----”“Ah--called on purpose, that we might help to establish the fact,” saidColonel Piercey, fiercely. “What do you call it but dotage--that tipover which you are inclined to weep; and the reason alleged for it, thatyou had been the first to tell him something? Yes, I know what thatmeans. Pownceby told me. That’s--how long since? But he believed it,just the same as ever, in the same kind of distant hope. What is thatbut dotage, Meg?”“And must it all, everything--the mere foolish hope I expressed toplease him, and anything she may have said--must it all be draggedbefore the public, and poor Uncle Giles’ foolish hopes?”“Would you like me to throw it all over, and leave that woman to enjoyher ill-gotten gains? Do you say I am to do that, Meg?”“I--say? Oh, no. What right have I? No, Cousin Gerald, I do not thinkyou should give up your claim. I think”--she paused a moment, and herface lighted up, the words seemed to drop from her lips. Other thoughtsflashed up in her eyes--an expectation, the light of happiness andpeace. The carriage had turned a corner, and Chillfold, with her cottagein it, and her boy, brought the relief and ease of home to Margaret’sface. Her companion watched her eagerly. He saw the change that cameover her. His thoughts followed hers with a quick revulsion of sympathy.He laid his hand upon hers.“Meg,” he said, “do you know there has never been anybody in the worldwhose face has lighted up like that for me?”“You had a mother, Gerald,” she said quickly, almost ashamed of herself-revelation; “but you forget--as Osy also will forget.”“At my age one wants something different from a mother,” he said, “andone does not forget.”She did not say anything. She did not meet his look; but she gave alittle pressure, scarcely perceptible, to the hand that held hers. Theirlong duel had come, at least, to peace--if nothing more.CHAPTER XLIV.Patty had a great deal to do before the trial; for it is needless to saythat no time was lost in bringing the matter to a trial. It was in somerespects an unequal contest, for, clever as she was, she knew no more towhom she should apply, or in whose hands she should place her cause,than any other person of her original position. Mr. Pownceby was theonly representative of law with whom she was acquainted, he and theshabby attorney of the village, who was the resort of litigious countryfolk. And Mr. Pownceby, whom she had insulted, was, as she had foreseen,on the other side. There was no help to be found in Miss Hewitt for anysuch need, except in so far that after many years’ strenuous reading ofall the trials in the papers, the names of certain distinguishedadvocates in various _causes célèbres_ and otherwise were at that lady’sfinger ends. The idea of the two women was to carry their business atonce, without any intervention of an intermediate authority, to one ofthe very greatest of these great men, with whom, indeed, Patty herselfmanaged to obtain an interview, with the boldness of ignorance. Thegreat man was much amused by Patty, but he did not undertake her case.He even suggested to her that it would be a good thing to compromisematters, and agree with her adversary in the way, which did not at allcommend itself to Mrs. Piercey. She would rather, she declared, spend tothe half of her kingdom than tamely compromise her “rights,” and leaveGreyshott to the heir-at-law. The Solicitor-General (I think it was thatfunctionary) was very kind. He was amused by her story, by her youth andgood looks, by her fierce determination and her ignorance. It was seldomthat he had so genuine a study of human nature before him, and thatinstinct of human nature which makes our own cause always seem the onethat is most just and right. He was moved to advise her to avoidlitigation rather from a desire to keep that piquant story for hisprivate gratification, instead of casting it abroad to all the winds,than from any higher motive. And yet he did a great deal for her,telling her who were the solicitors in whose hands she ought to placeherself, with a sense that Mrs. Piercey would not be too particularabout the means used to secure her success; and suggesting counsel withsomething of the same idea, and a somewhat malicious amusement anddelighted expectation of what would be made of the case by suchadvocates. He would no more have suggested either the one or the otherto Margaret Osborne, than he could have justified himself on moralgrounds for recommending them to Mrs. Piercey. Like clients likeadvisers, he said to himself. He felt that Patty in the witness-box,manipulated by his learned brother, would be a sight for the---- well,not perhaps for the gods, unless it were the gods of the shillinggallery, whom such an advocate would cause to weep over the youngwidow’s woes--but for the delectation of the observant and cynicalspectator. How wicked and wrong this was it is needless to say; and yetin the mingled issues of human concerns it was very kind to Patty, whowas not, as he divined, particular about the modes to be employed in hercampaign.I will not enter into all those preparations for the trial whichbrightened life immensely to Mrs. Piercey, and made her feel that shehad scarcely lived before, and that, however the trial might turn out,this crowded hour of glorious life was worth the age without a namewhich would have been her fate had all been peaceful and undisturbed.She had constant visits from her solicitors or their emissaries;constant correspondence; a necessity often recurring for running up totown, which opened to her many new delights. No expense was spared inthese preliminaries, the lawyers, to whom the speculative character ofthe whole proceedings was clearly apparent, thinking it well (they were,as has been said, not scrupulous members of their class) to make as muchout of it in the meantime as possible; and Patty herself having, in adifferent degree, something of the same feeling. She was ready, as hasbeen said, to sacrifice half of her kingdom in order to win her plea,and, at the same time, she indulged freely in the pleasure of spending,with the idea before her that even in the event of losing, that pleasurecould not be taken from her. Whatever she acquired now would, in thatrespect, be pure gain. Therefore there can be no doubt that she enjoyedher life during this interval. She had committed one or twoimprudencies, which her advisers much regretted and gently condemned.She had made an enemy of Dunning for one thing, which they blamedgreatly, and she had alienated the sympathies of her neighbours by herbehaviour in the first flush of her triumph, which Lady Hartmore did notfail to publish. But if the client were not foolish sometimes, to whatgood would be the cleverness of her guides and counsellors? Patty, forher part, declared that she had no fear of Dunning. What could Dunningsay that could affect her position? He could describe Sir Giles’ hopes,which, it was evident, must have been mistaken; but she could swear,with a good conscience, that she had never said anything about thosehopes to Sir Giles. Patty’s modesty, the instinct that had made herreally incapable of taking advantage of Sir Giles’ delusion, had, it isto be feared, by this time, by dint of familiarity with the subject,become much subdued. She had shrunk with a blush from any suchdiscussion, even with her old father-in-law; but she was not afraid nowof the ordeal of being examined and cross-examined on the subject beforeall the world. She was not, indeed, at all afraid of the examinationwhich nowadays frightens most people out of their wits. This, no doubt,was partly ignorance, but it was partly also a happy confidence in herown power to encounter and discomfit any man who should stand up toquestion her. This confidence has been seen in various cases of youngwomen who have encountered jauntily an ordeal in which it is difficultfor the strongest not to come to grief; but an ignorant girl oftenbelieves in her own sharp answers more than in any inquisition in theworld.Except these advisers-at-law, however, and her aunt, whom she by nomeans permitted to be always with her, Patty had actually no supportersor sympathisers. She lived in her great house alone: nobody entering itsave one of these advisers; nobody sitting at her table with her; nobodytaking any share in the excitement of her life. She had indeed waylaidthe rector one day, and compelled him to come to her carriage door tospeak to her, which he did with great reluctance, being openly andavowedly on the other side. “What have I ever done to you that youshould be against me?” she said; “you used to be my friend once----”“I hope I am everybody’s friend--who does well,” said the rector.“And haven’t I done well? If to nurse old Sir Giles night and day, andlay myself out in everything to please him wasn’t doing well, why, thenI must have been taught my duty very badly, for I thought it was ‘I wassick and ye---- ’”“Oh! that is how people force a text and put their own meaning to it,”said the rector, with a gesture of impatience. “But,” he added, in amore subdued tone, “nobody denies, Mrs. Piercey, that you were kind tothe old man.”“And wasn’t that my duty?” said Patty, triumphantly; but though shesilenced her spiritual instructor she did not convince him that it washis duty to support her. No text about the wrongs of the widow had anyeffect upon him. He stood and looked down at the summer dust in whichhis feet were planted, and shook his head. It is a great thing to havethe enthusiasm of a cause to prop you up, and to have lawyers coming andgoing from town, and a great deal of business on hand; but to havenobody to speak to, nobody to give you either help or sympathy at home,is hard. When Patty came home from London, after one of the expeditionsin which she had been more or less enjoying herself, the blank of thehouse, in which there was not a soul who cared whether she won or lost,whether she lived or died, was sometimes more than she could bear. Oneevening, late in July, she went out for a walk, which was a very unusualthing with her, upon the great stretch of common land which lay outsidethe beech avenue. Patty had begun by this time to grow so muchaccustomed to the use of a carriage, that she no longer felt it the mostdelightful mode of conveyance. She had at first, when she came into thepossession of that luxury, felt it impossible to walk half a dozen stepswithout her carriage at her heels; but now she became a little bored bythe necessity of a daily drive, and loved to escape for a little walk.She had been in town all day, and it had been hot and uncomfortable.Patty had nowhere to go to in town for a little lunch and refreshment,as ladies have generally. It seemed a wrong to her that ladies had that;that they went in twos and threes enjoying their shopping and theirlittle expedition, laughing and talking to each other, as some did whohad gone to town in the same carriage with her, and again had travelledwith her coming down, full of news and chatter and purchases. Patty hadno one to go with her--there was no house in town where there werefriends who expected to see her at lunch; and when she came back, thoughshe might have bought the most charming things in the world, thoughthere might be diamonds in her little bag, there was nobody to wish tosee them, to exclaim over their beauty, and envy their happy possessor.These ladies sometimes spoke to her when they did not know her, butoften looked askance and whispered to each other; and anyhow, thecontrast they made with herself inflamed her very soul with anger. Theycould wander out, too, in the cool of the evening, still talking,laughing over their adventures, while she was always alone. It wassoothing to see that many of them drove home from the station in a bitof a pony carriage or shabby little waggonette with one horse, while hercarriage waited for her in lonely grandeur. Sometimes, even, theywalked, carrying their parcels, while Patty looked down upon them withimmeasurable contempt. But a carriage is not good for everything, andPatty sometimes strayed out alone, thinking the exercise would be goodfor her, but in reality hoping to escape a little from herself.It was seldom that she met any one on that lonely moor, but on thisparticular evening there came towards her, with the glow behind him ofthe setting sun, a figure, which Patty felt to be, somehow, familiar;though as she did not expect to meet with any one here equal to herquality, she was not at all curious, but even contemptuous of anypedestrian who was not, like herself, walking for pleasure, but mightprobably be obliged to walk. He carried a long cricket-bag in his hand,and was in white flannels, which made a little brightening in thedimness of the evening, and had a light cap of a bright colour on hishead. A well-made, manly figure, slim but strong, and a long swingingstep clearing the intervening distance swiftly, made Patty think of someone who had been like that, who would not have let her, in other days,be alone if he could have helped it. She remembered very clearly whothat was, and with a little shiver how she had last seen him, and thedance he had been to, and how the thought of that dance moved her to thedepths. But this could not be Roger. He had always been fond ofcricket--too fond, the village said--liking that better than steadywork. But to be dressed like this, in flannels, and a cap of a “colour,”was not for common men like him; that was the dress gentlemen put on forthe play which was their only work to so many. Indeed, Patty was closeupon him before she saw that it was indeed Roger, who took off his capwhen he saw her, and would have passed on with that respectfulsalutation had, not Patty stopped almost without meaning it, in thestart of recognition. “Is it you?” she said in her surprise, upon whichRoger took off his cap again.“Seems as if I’d risen in the world,” he said, “but it’s more seemingthan fact. I’ve been playing for the county,” he added, with scarcelyconcealed pride. “It don’t do a man much good, perhaps, but we’repleased enough all the same.”“It’s a long time since I have seen you,” said Patty, scarcely knowingwhat she said. “I--I took you for one of the gentlemen.”“And it’s a long time since I’ve seen you--and I’d like to say that I’msorry, Pa----, Mrs. Piercey, for all that’s happened--and for thetrouble, if it is a trouble, you’re in now.”“It is no trouble,” said Patty, hotly. “I’m going to defend my rights,if that’s what you mean.”“Well, I hope that’s what it is,” said Roger, “but I don’t like to hearof any one I care for beginning with the law. It just skins you aliveand wastes good money that might be spent far better--bring you in adeal more pleasure, I mean.”“You don’t know very much, Roger, about the pleasure money brings in!”“Oh, don’t I, Patty! Well, if one of us remembers the old days the othermust, too. Cricketing about all over the place as I’m doing, runsthrough a good lot, I can tell you, if it didn’t bring a little morein.”“Don’t you do anything but cricket, nowadays?” she said.“Not much; but it pays well enough,” said Roger, pushing back his capfrom his forehead.The evening, it is true, was getting a little dim, though not dark; butdidn’t he look a gentleman! No one would have guessed he wasn’t agentleman, was the thought that passed through Patty’s mind like a dart.“And I live a lot among the swells, now,” he said, “and I hear what theysay; I don’t want to offend you, Patty, far from it--but ain’t it a boreliving all by yourself in that big lonesome house, with all the deathsand things that have happened in it?”“You forget it’s my home,” said Patty, drawing herself up.“Well, is it your home? All right if it had been your husband’s or ifthere had been an heir; but I don’t hold myself with a place going outof the family like that--that has been in it for hundreds of years. Idon’t like the thoughts of the Seven Thorns even going out o’ the nameof ’Ewitt. It’s no concern of mine, but I don’t.”“Perhaps you think I should go back there, out of my own place, and keepit up!”“I don’t say as I meant that,” said Roger, turning his cap, which he hadtaken off, round and round in his hands, “but I wouldn’t be the one totake it out of the family if it was me. I’d say, Look here now, what’llyou give me? You be happy in your way, and I’ll be happy in mine.”“Well, I shall take your advice, Mr. Pearson. I’ll be happy in my ownway. It’s not yours, and never will be. But that don’t matter, seeingwe’ve nothing on earth to do with each other, and are in quite differentranks of life. I wish you good-night, and I hope the cricketing businesswill be a good one and pay, or else I might say, ‘Mind, there’s thewinter coming on'--if a lady could take upon her to give advice to asporting man.”“Patty,” he cried, calling after her, “don’t part with a fellow likethis; I didn’t mean to offend you--far from it. I only thought I’d warnyou what folks said.”“Folks is fools for the most part,” cried Patty fiercely, using amuch-cited sentiment, which she had never heard of, by the light ofnature, “and I don’t want to hear what they say. Mr. Pearson, I wish yougood-night.”“There! I’ve been and put my foot in it--I knew I should,” Roger said.He stood, the image of despondency, in the middle of the moor, his whitefigure standing out against the western light as Patty turned at a sharpangle to go home. She could see him with the corner of her eye withoutlooking at him. He stood there silent for a moment, and then dashed hisfist into the air with a profane exclamation. “That’s not what I meantat all,” he said, and lifted his cricket-bag and sped away.What was it that went out of the evening with him, when Patty, venturingto glance round, saw the landscape empty of the man who had offended herso deeply, who had ventured to blame her--her a lady so far abovehim--Mrs. Piercey of Greyshott, while he was only a cricketer, an idlefellow about the country, no good, as even the village people said? Butyet a dreariness settled down upon the world; night came on and thatloneliness which seemed now Patty’s fate. Well, she said to herself,what did she care? She had her fine estate, her name that was as good asthe best, her grand house, as much money to spend as she chose, andnobody to dictate to her what she should do--no, nobody to dictate toher--nobody even to advise, to say, “That’s right, Patty!” Her AuntPatience did that, it was true, but then Aunt Patience’s approval, savein the very extremity of having nobody else, did not count for much. Shehurried in; but it was lonely, lonelier even than the moor--nobody tospeak to, nobody to break the long row of chairs and sofas which werethere with the intention of accommodating half the county, but now hadnobody to sit down upon them but Patty’s self, moving from one toanother with a futile feeling of breaking the solitude. But nothing wasto be had to break that solitude except Aunt Patience. Mrs. Piercey ofGreyshott rang the bell, and ordered the carriage to be sent at once tothe village to fetch Miss Hewitt immediately, without a minute’s delay!That she could do--send out her carriage, and her horses, and hersecretly-swearing servants for any caprice at any moment. For MissHewitt! It was what might be called an anti-climax, if Patty had knownwhat that meant. She did know what it meant deeply to the bottom of herheart, though she was not acquainted with the word. To go through allthat she had gone through, to do all she had done, for the sake ofhaving the company of Miss Hewitt and her sympathy and encouragement!could there be a greater drop of deepest downfall from the highestheights than this?But the trial was coming on, and soon all England would be ringing withPatty’s name and story and fortunes. She would have crowds of people toadmire and wonder at her. She would win her cause in the sight of allEngland. She would be the heroine of the day, in everybody’s mouth.Surely there would be some compensation in that.CHAPTER XLV.I refrain from attempting to describe the great trial Piercey v.Piercey, which made the whole country ring. It was, indeed, a _causecélèbre_, and may be found, no doubt, by every one who wishes to traceit, in the history of such notable romances which exists in the legalrecords. It was so managed by the exceedingly clever advocates whomPatty had been fortunate enough to secure, as to entertain the country,morning after morning in the columns of the _Times_, by a living pieceof family history, a household opened up and laid bare to every curiouseye, which is, perhaps, the thing of all others which delights theBritish public (and all other publics) the most. Poor old Sir Giles, inhis wheeled chair, with his backgammon board and all his weaknesses,became as familiar a figure to the reader of the newspapers as anythingin Dickens or Thackeray--more familiar even than Sir Pitt Crawley,because he reached a still larger circle of readers and was a realperson, incontestable fact, and only buried the other day. England forthe moment became as intimately acquainted with the Softy, as even theold labourers in the parlour at the Seven Thorns. The story, as it wasunfolded by the prosecution, was one not favourable to the heroine--agirl out of a roadside tavern, who had married the half-witted son ofthe squire, who had almost forced her way into the house on the death ofits mistress, who had contrived so to cajole the poor old gentleman thathe gave himself up entirely to her influence, and finally left her hisestates and everything of which he was possessed--leaving out even hisold servants whom he had provided for in his previous will, and givingabsolute power to the little adventuress. This was a story which did notconciliate the favour of the public. But when it came to the pleadingson the other side, and Patty was revealed as a ministering angel, bothto her husband and father-in-law, as having worked the greatestimprovement in the one, so that it was hoped he would soon take hisplace among his country neighbours; and as having protected and solacedthe failing days of the other, and been his only companion and consoler,a great change took place in the popular sentiment. It soon becameapparent to the world that this little adventuress was one of those rarewomen who are never out of place in whatever class they may appear in,the lowest or the highest, and are always in their sphere doing good toeverybody. The drama was unfolded with the greatest skill: even those“hopes” which it was not denied Sir Giles had greatly built upon, andthe disappointment of which, when the young widow found herself deceivedin her fond anticipations, was the crudest blow of all. The women whowere present shed tears almost without exception over poor Patty’sdelusion; and that she should have implored the lawyer not to dispelthat delusion, to let poor Sir Giles die happy, still believing it, wasmade to appear the most beautiful trait of character. And indeed, as amatter of fact, Patty had meant well in this particular, and it wouldhave been highly to her credit had it been separated from all that cameafter. Dunning’s testimony, which had been much built upon by theprosecution, was very much weakened by the account given of his variousnegligences; especially of the fact proved by the lady herself that hehad accompanied his master to Lady Piercey’s funeral, without providinghimself with any restorative to administer to the old gentleman on anoccasion of so much excitement and distress, and of such unusualfatigue. “I would not permit it even to be thought of, that he shouldattend my husband’s funeral. It would have been too much for him,” Pattysaid, with all the eloquence of her crape and her widow’s cap to enhancewhat she said. But, indeed, I am here doing precisely what I said Iwould not attempt to do--and I was not present at the trial to give thedetails with the confidence of an eye-witness. The consequence, however,was, as all the world knows, that the verdict was for the defendant, andthat Patty came out triumphantly mistress of the field, and ofGreyshott, and of all that old Sir Giles had committed to her hands.A romance of real life! It was, indeed, a disappointment and loss tothe whole country when the great Piercey case was over. Even oldgentlemen who were supposed to care for nothing but politics and theprice of stocks, threw down the _Times_ with an angry exclamation thatthere was nothing in it, the first dull morning or two after that casewas concluded. Thus Patty was a benefactor to her kind without anyintention of being so. People were generally sorry for the Pierceys,who, there was no doubt, had a right to be disappointed and even angryto see their ancient patrimony thus swept away into the hands of astranger. For nobody entertained the slightest doubt that Patty wouldmarry and set up a new family out of the ashes of the old. And whyshouldn’t she? the people cried who knew nothing about it. Was it notthe very principle of the British constitution to be always taking innew blood to revive the old? Was not the very peerage constantlyleavened by this process; new lords being made out of cotton and coalsand beer and all the industries to give solidity to the lesseningphalanx of the sons of the Crusaders? Old Sir Francis Piercey, who wasthe plaintiff, was well enough off to pay his costs, and he ought to beable at his age to reconcile himself to the loss! To be sure, there washis son, a very distinguished soldier. Well! he had better marry theyoung widow, everybody said, and settle the matter so.The county people did not, however, take this view. They were wrothbeyond expression on the subject of this intruder into their midst.Nobody had called upon her but Lady Hartmore, whose indignation knew nobounds; who had never forgiven her husband, and never would forgive him,she declared, for having betrayed her into that visit. “But to be sure Inever should have known what the minx was if I had not seen her!” thatlady said. Patty was completely tabooed on every side. Even the rectorturned off the highroad when he saw her carriage approaching, and ran byan improvised path over the fields not to meet her. Wherever she mightfind companions or friends it was evidently not to be in her owndistrict. Her old friends were servants in one great house or another,or the wives of cottagers and labourers; and Patty was altogetherunaware of their existence. When she drove about the county, as she didvery much and often in the impulse of her triumph, her eyes met onlyfaces which were very familiar but which she would not know, or facesglimpsed at afar off which would not know her. She was undisputedmistress of Greyshott, and all its revenues and privileges. All theneighbouring land belonged to her, and almost every house in thevillage; but except to Miss Hewitt, her aunt, and the servants of thehouse, and, occasionally, some much-mistaken woman from one of thecottages, who felt emboldened to make a petition to the lady ofGreyshott on the score of having been at school with her, Patty spoke tonobody, or rather had nobody to speak to, which is a better statement ofthe case.With one large exception, however, so long as the trial lasted, whenlawyers and lawyers’ clerks had constant missions to Greyshott, and thedistinguished barrister who won her cause for her, came over on a fewdays’ visit. That visit was, in fact, though it was the greatest triumphand glory to Patty, one of the most terrible ordeals she had to gothrough. He was a most amusing visitor, with endless stories to tell andcompliments to pay, and would have made almost any party, in any countryhouse which had the good fortune to receive him, “go off,” by his ownunaided exertions. But it is to be doubted if this brilliant orator andspecial pleader had ever in his life formed the whole of a country-houseparty, with a little, smart, under-bred person and a village spinsterfor his sole hosts. He was appalled, it must be allowed, and felt that acurious new light was thrown upon the story which he made into a romanceof real life; but all the same, it need not be said, this gentlemanexerted himself to make the three days “go off” as if the house had beenfull, and the Prime Minister among the guests. But to describe what thiswas to Patty would require something more than the modest store of wordsI have at my disposal. She was not so ignorant as Miss Hewitt, whoenjoyed the good the gods had provided for her without _arrière pensée_,and began to laugh before the delighted guest had opened his lips. Pattyknew that there should be people invited “to meet” a man so well known.She knew that there ought to have been a party in the house, or, atleast, distinguished company to dinner. And she had nobody, not eventhe rector! She did her best to invent reasons why So-and-so andSo-and-so could not come, and made free use of the name of LordHartmore, who, she thought, with the instinct of her kind, had been madeto give her up by his wife. She even made use of the fact that mostpeople in the county were displeased with her on account of the trial,and because they wished the Pierceys to be still at Greyshott. “And sothey are, in the person of much the most attractive member of thefamily,” the great man said, who would have been still more amused byhis position between these two ladies if he had not been in his ownperson something of a black sheep, and a little on the alert to seehimself avoided and neglected. Patty was not aware that he would nothave ventured to pay these compliments to another kind of hostess; butshe suffered intently from the fact that she had nobody to invite tomeet him, nobody who would come to her even for a night, to keep herguest in countenance. She demeaned herself so far as to write to therector begging of him to come. But the rector had another engagement andwould not, or could not, consent. Poor Patty! She suffered in many waysfrom being thus, as it were, out of the bonds of all human society, butnever so much as in that dreadful three days. He was (as she thought)old, and he was fat, and not at all well-looking, though he was soamusing; but he gave her to understand before he went away that he wouldnot mind marrying Mrs. Piercey of Greyshott. And so did one of thesolicitors who instructed him, the younger one, who was unmarried; andthere was a head clerk, nothing more than a head clerk, who looked verymuch as if a similar proposal was on his lips. “Like his impudence!”Patty said, though she really knew nothing of the young man. Threeproposals, or almost proposals of marriage, within a week or two! Thispleased the natural mind of Patty of the Seven Thorns, but it gave Mrs.Piercey occasion to think. They were all concerned with securingproperty for her, and assuring her in its possession, and they thoughtnaturally that nobody had so good a right to help her take care of it.But this reasoning was not by any means agreeable to Patty, who,flattered at first, became exceedingly angry afterwards when she foundherself treated so frankly as an appendage to her property.“Of course I knew it was always like that as soon as you had a littlemoney!” she said, indignantly.“Not with ’im, Patty, not with ’im,” said Miss Hewitt, upon whom thebrilliant barrister had made a great impression.“Him!” cried Patty, “a fat old man!”“You can’t have everything,” said her aunt. “For my part I’d rather ’avea man like that, that’s such fine company, and as you never could bedull as long as ’e was there, than a bit of a cock robin with an’andsome face, and nothing behind it!”“If you are meaning my Gervase, Aunt Patience, I----”“Lord, I never thought o’ your Gervase! Bless us, ’e ’ad no ’andsomeface, whatever else!” the old lady cried. She was sent home that eveningin the carriage, and Patty, angry, indignant, desolate, remainedaltogether alone. It was hard to say which was worst, the dreadfulconsciousness of having “nobody to meet” a guest, or being withoutguests altogether. She walked up and down her solitary house, enteringone room after another; all deserted and empty. The servants, aswell-bred servants should, got out of the way when they heard herapproaching, so that not even in the corridor upstairs did she see ahousemaid, or in the hall below a shadow of butler or footman to breakthe sensation of solitude. To be sure, she knew where to find Jerninghamseated in her light and pleasant chamber sewing; but Jerningham wassomewhat unapproachable, occupied with her work, quite above idlegossip, and indisposed to entertain her mistress; for Jerninghamflattered herself that she knew her place. What was Patty to do? Theunder-housemaid was a Greyshott girl who had been at school with her;therefore it may be perceived how great was the necessity forremembering always who she was, and never relaxing her dignity. Shemight have gone abroad, which she was aware was a thing that was donewith great success sometimes by ladies who could travel about with maidand footman, and no need to think of expense. But Patty felt that shecould not consent to descend among the common herd in search ofacquaintances, and that her grandeur was nothing to her unless it wasacknowledged and enjoyed at home. And then the winter was coming on,Patty was not yet sufficiently educated to know that winter wasprecisely the time to go abroad. She knew nothing in the world butGreyshott, and it was only for applause and admiration at Greyshott thatshe really cared.It was in these circumstances that the winter passed, the second winteronly since Patty’s marriage, which had lifted her so far above all herantecedents and old companions. It was a long and dreary winter, withmuch rain, and that dull and depressing atmosphere of cloud, when heavenand earth is of the same colour, and there is not even the variety offrost and thaws to break the monotonous languor of the long dead darkweeks. Patty did not bate an inch of her grandeur either for herloneliness or for the aggravation of that loneliness which was in thegreat rooms, untenanted as they were. She did not take to the littlecheerful morning-room in which Lady Piercey had been glad to spend thegreater part of her life in such wintry weather. Patty dined alone inthe great dining-room, which it was so difficult to light up, and shesat alone all the evening through in the great drawing-room, with allits white and gold, where her little figure, still all black from headto foot, was almost lost in a corner, and formed but a speck upon thebrightness of the large vacant carpet, and lights that seemed to shinefor their own pleasure. Poor Patty! She sat and thought of the lastwinter, which was melancholy enough, but not so bad as this: of old SirGiles and his backgammon board, and Dunning standing behind backs. Itwas not exciting, but it was “company” at least. She thought of herselfsitting there, flattering the old gentleman about his play, smiling andbeaming upon him, yet feeling so sick of it all; and of that night--thatnight! when Roger Pearson had been at the dance, and brought Gervase infrom the moor, to be laid on the bed from which he was never to rise.Her mind did not dwell upon Gervase, but it is astonishing how often shethought upon that dance at which her rejected lover had been enjoyinghimself, while she sat playing backgammon with her father-in-law, andlistening for her husband. What a contrast! The picture had been burnedin upon her mind by the event connected with it, and now had much moreeffect than that event. She could almost see the rustic couples withtheir arms entwined, and the romping flirtations of the barn, and thesmoky lamps hung about, so different, so different from the steady softwaxen lights which threw an unbroken illumination upon her solitaryhead! It was bad then, but it was almost worse now, when she had nocompany at all, except Aunt Patience from time to time, as long as Mrs.Piercey could put up with her. And this was all--all! that her rise inthe world had brought her! She had done nothing very bad to procure thatrise. If Gervase had lived it would have been good for him that she hadmarried him, she still felt sure, notwithstanding that in actual fact ithad not done him much good; and it was good for Sir Giles to have hadher society and ministrations in the end of his life. Everybody allowedthat--even the hostile lawyer at the trial, even the sullen Dunning,who had occasion to dislike her if anybody had, who had lost his legacyand almost his character by her means. Even he had been instrumental inproving to the world how she had cheered and comforted the old man. Andshe had got her reward--everything but that title, which it was grievousto her to think of; which, perhaps, if she had got it--if Gervase hadonly had the sense to live six months longer--would have made all thedifference! She had got her reward, and this was what it had come to--aquietness in which you could hear a pin drop; a loneliness never brokenby any voice except those of her servants, of whom she must not, anddared not, make friends. Poor Patty! once so cheerful, so admired andconsidered at the Seven Thorns, with her life so full of bustle andliveliness--this was all she had come to after her romance in real life.I cannot help thinking that if there had been a lady at the rectory,this state of affairs would have been mended, and that a good mother,with her family to set out in the world, would have seen the advantagefor her own children of doing her best to attract acquaintances andcompany to Greyshott. But the rector was only a man, and a timid one,fearing to break the bonds of convention, and his daughters were tooyoung to take the matter into their own hands. They might have done ithad Mrs. Piercey waited for a few years; but then Patty had noinclination to wait.CHAPTER XLVI.Mrs. Piercey went to town after Easter, as she was aware everybody whorespected themselves, who were in Society, or who had any money tospend, did. But, alas! she did not know how to manage this any more thanto find the usual solace in country life. She was, indeed, still morehelpless in town; for no doubt in the country, if she had been patient,there would at last have been found somebody who would have had courageto break the embargo, to defy Lord and Lady Hartmore and all thepartisans of the old family, and to call upon the lady of Greyshott. Butin town what could Patty do? She knew nobody but the distant cousinssomewhere in the depths of Islington, to whom she had gone at the timeof her marriage, but whom she had taken care to forget the veryexistence of as soon as her need for them was over. Mrs. Piercey went toa fashionable hotel, and engaged a handsome set of rooms, and sat downand waited for happiness to come to her. She had her maid with her, theirreproachable Jerningham, who would not allow her mistress to demeanherself by making a companion of her; and she had Robert, the footman,and her own coachman from Greyshott, and a new victoria in which todrive about--all the elements of happiness--poor Patty! and yet it wouldnot come. She had permitted herself, by this time, to drop the weight ofher mourning, and to blossom forth in grey and white; and she drove inthe Park in the most beautiful costumes, with the old fat Greyshotthorses, who were in themselves a certificate that she was somebody, nomushroom of a _parvenue_. So was the coachman, who was the real oldGreyshott coachman, and (evidently) had been in the family forgenerations. She drove steadily every day along the sacred promenade,and was seen of everybody, and discussed among various bands ofonlookers, whose only occupation, like the Athenians, was that of seeingor hearing some new thing. Who was she? That she was not of the style ofher horses and her coachman was apparent at a glance. Where had she gotthem? Was it an attempt on the part of some visitor from the ends of theearth to pose as a lady of established family? Was it, perhaps, a daring_coup_ on the part of some person, not at all _comme il faut_, toattract the observation and curiosity of the world? Patty’s little face,with its somewhat fast prettiness, half abashed, half impudent, shoneout of its surroundings with a contradiction to all those suppositions.The Person would not have been at all abashed, but wholly impudent, orelse quite assured and satisfied with herself; and in any case she wouldnot have been alone. A stranger, above all, would not have been alone.There would have been a bevy of other women with her, making merry overall the novelty about them, and this, probably, would have been the casehad the other idea been correct. But who was this, with the face of apretty housemaid and the horses of a respectable dowager? Some of thegentlemen in the park, who amused themselves with these speculations,would, no doubt, have managed to resolve their doubts on the subject hadnot Patty been, as much as Una, though she was so different a character,enveloped in an atmosphere of such unquestionable good behaviour andmodesty as no instructed eye could mistake. Women, who are lessinstructed on such matters, may mistake; but not men, who have bettermeans of knowing. Thus Patty did make a little commotion; but as she hadno means of knowing of it, and no one to tell her, it did her no good inthe world.And she went a good many times to the theatre, and to the opera, thoughit bored her. But this was a great ordeal: to go into a box all alone,and subject herself to the opera-glasses of the multitude. Patty did notmind it at first. She liked to be seen, and had no objection that peopleshould look at her, and her diamonds; and there was a hope that it mightlead to something in her mind. But how could it lead to anything? forshe knew nobody who was likely to be seen at the opera. When she wenthome in the evening she could have cried for disappointment andmortification. Was this all? Was there never to be anything more thanthis? Was all her life to be spent thus in luxury and splendour; alwaysalone?At first she had dined in solitary state in her rooms, as she thought itright, in her position, to do. But when Patty heard that other people ofequal pretensions--one of them the baronet’s lady, whom it was herdespair not to be--went down to the general dining-room for their meals,she was too happy to go there too, thinking she must, at least, makesome acquaintance with the other dwellers in the hotel. But things werenot much better there, for Mrs. Piercey was established at a littletable by herself in great state, but unutterable solitude, watching witha sick heart the groups about her--the people who were going to thetheatre, or to such delights of balls and evening parties as Patty hadnever known. There was but one solitary person beside herself, and thatwas an old gentleman, with his napkin tucked into his buttonhole, whowas absorbed by the _menu_ and evidently thought of nothing else. Pattywatched the groups with hungry eyes--the men in their evening coats,with wide expanses of white; the ladies, who evidently intended to dressafter this semi-public dinner. Oh, how she longed to belong to some one,to have some one belonging to her! And such a little thing, she thought,would do it: nothing more than an introduction, nothing beyond theadvent of some one who knew her, who would say, “Mrs. Piercey ofGreyshott,” and the ice would be broken. But then that some one who knewher, where was he or she to be found?Alas! there came a moment when both he and she were found, and that wasthe worst of all. She was seated listlessly in her usual solitude, whenshe saw a pair of people who were taking their seats at a table not faroff. They had their backs turned towards her, and yet they seemedfamiliar to Patty. They were both tall, the gentleman with a militaryair, the lady with a little bend in her head which Patty thought sheknew. There was about them that indefinable air of being lately marriedwhich it is so very difficult to obliterate, though they did not lookvery young. The lady was quietly dressed, or rather she was in a dresswhich was the symbol of quiet--quakerly, or motherly, to ourgrandmothers: grey satin, but with such reflections and shadows in it,as has made it in our better instructed age one of the most perfectlydecorative of fabrics. Patty, experienced by this time in the habits andcustoms of the people she watched so wistfully, was of opinion that theywere going to the opera. Who were they? She knew them--oh, certainly sheknew them; and they evidently knew several of the groups about; and nowat last Patty’s opportunity had surely come.I think by this time Mrs. Piercey of Greyshott had acquired a forlornlook, the consequence of her many disappointments. It is not pleasant tosit and watch people who are better off than we are, howeverphilosophical and high-minded we may be; and Patty, it need not be said,was neither. Her mouth had got a little droop at the corners, her eyes alittle fixity, as of staring and weariness in staring. She was too muchdressed for the dining-room of a hotel, and she had very manifestly theair of being alone, and of being accustomed to be alone. I think that,as so often happens, Patty was on the eve of finding the acquaintancefor whom her soul longed, at these very moments when her burden wasabout to become too much for her to bear; and she certainly had attainedrecognition in the world outside, as was to be proved to her no laterthan to-night. Such coincidences are of frequent occurrence in humanaffairs. It had become known in the hotel to some kind people, who hadwatched her solitude as she watched their cheerful company, who she was;and the matron of the party had remembered how much that was good hadbeen said of Patty on the trial, and how kind she had been to the oldman who had left her all his money without any doing of hers. “Poorlittle thing! I shall certainly take an opportunity of speaking to herto-morrow,” this lady was saying, as Patty watched with absorbedattention the other people. Indeed, the compassion of this good womanmight have hastened her purpose and made her “speak” that very night,had not Patty been so bent upon those other people whom she was more andmore sure she knew; and what a difference--what a difference in her lifemight that have made! But she never knew--which was, perhaps, in thecircumstances, a good thing.It was while Patty’s attention was called away perforce by the waiterwho attended to her, that the other people at whom she had been gazingbecame aware of her presence. The gentleman had turned a bronzed face,full of the glow of warmer suns than ours, in her direction, and startedvisibly. He was a man whom the reader has seen habitually with anotherexpression--that of perplexity and general discontent; a man with atemper, and with little patience, though capable of better things. Hehad apparently got to these better things now. His face was lighted upwith happiness; he was bending over the little table, which, small as itwas, seemed too much to separate them, to talk to his wife, with the airof a man who has so much and so many things to say, that he has not aminute to lose in the outpouring of his heart. She was full of response,if not perhaps so overflowing; but on her aspect, too, there had come awonderful change. Her beautiful grey satin gown was not more unlike theunfailing black which Mrs. Osborne always wore, than the poor relationof Greyshott was to Gerald Piercey’s wife, Meg Piercey once again. Itwould be vain to enter upon all the preliminaries which brought aboutthis happy conclusion. Margaret had many difficulties to get over, whichto everybody else appeared fantastical enough. A second marriage is athing which, in theory, few women like; and to cease to belong solely toOsy, and to bear another name than his, though it was her own, was verypainful to her. Yet these difficulties had all been got over, even if Ihad space to enter into them; which, seeing that Patty is all this timewaiting, dallying with her undesired dinner, and wondering who thesepeople are whom she seems to know, would be uncalled for in the highestdegree.When the waiter came up to the solitary lady at the table, and ColonelPiercey turned his face in that direction, he started and swore underhis breath, “By Jove!” though he was not a man addicted to expletives.Then he said, “Meg! Meg!” under his breath; “who do you think is sittingbehind you at that table? Don’t turn round. Mrs. Piercey, as sure aslife!”“Mrs. Piercey?” She was bewildered for a moment. “There are so many Mrs.Pierceys. Whom do you mean?”“One more than there used to be, for my salvation,” the bridegroom said;and then added, with a laugh, “but no other like this one, Meg--Mrs.Piercey of Greyshott----”“Patty!” cried Margaret, under her breath.“If you dare to be so familiar with so great a lady--the heroine of thetrial, poor Uncle Giles’ good angel----”“Oh, don’t be bitter, Gerald! It is all over and done with; and whoknows, if it had been otherwise----”“Whether we should ever have come together?” he said: “you know best, sofar as that goes, my love; and if it might have been so, good luck toGreyshott, and I am glad we have not got it. Yes, there she is, theidentical Patty; and none the better for her success, I should say,looking very much bored and rather pale.”“Who is with her?” asked Margaret.“There is nobody with her that I can see. No, she is quite alone, andbored, as I told you; and in a diamond necklace,” he said with a laugh.“Alone, and with a diamond necklace, in the dining-room of a hotel!”“Well, why not? To show it and herself, of course; and probably a muchbetter way than any other in her power to show them.”“Oh, Gerald, don’t be so merciless. She has got your inheritance; butstill, it was really Uncle Giles’ will, and she was kind to him--evenold Dunning could not deny that. And if Gervase had lived----”“It was as well he did not live, poor fellow, for her as well as forhimself, though I should certainly, myself, have preferred it; for thenwe should have had none of this fuss, either of anticipation ordisappointment--and no trial, and no costs; and no useless baronetcythat brings in nothing.”“Don’t say that; your father likes it, and so will you in your day.”“My father likes to be head of the family, and so shall I. We’ll haveour first quarrel, Meg, over that little hussy, then.”“Not our first quarrel by a great many,” she said, letting her hand restfor a moment on his arm. “But don’t call her names, Gerald: all alone ina hotel in London, in the middle of the season, without a creature tospeak a word to her! And I heard she was perfectly alone all the winterat home. Lady Hartmore goes too far. She has made it a personal matterthat nobody should call. Poor little Patty! Gerald----”“Poor little Patty, indeed! who has cost us not only Greyshott, but howmany thousand pounds; who has made you poor, Meg.”“There is poor and poor. Poor in your way is not poor in mine. I amrich, whatever you may be. Is she still there--alone--Gerald, with thatwhite little face?” Margaret had managed, furtively, to turn her head,still under shadow of the waiter, and get a glimpse of their supplanter.“What does it matter if her face is white or not? She has chalked it,perhaps, as she might rouge it on another occasion, to play her part.”“You have no pity,” said Margaret; “to me it is very sad to see a poorwoman like that alone, trying to enjoy herself. I think, Gerald, Iwill----”“Will what? You are capable of anything, Meg. I shall not be surprisedat whatever you propose.”“Well, since you have so poor an opinion of me,” she said with a smile,“I think I’ll speak to her, Gerald.”“Do you remember that she turned you out of your home? that she insultedyou so that it was with difficulty I kept my temper?”“You never did keep your temper, dear,” said Margaret with gentleimpartiality, shaking her head; “and,” she added with a smile, “youinsulted me far worse than ever Patty did. Should I bear malice? I willsay a word to her before we go.”When they rose, and when Patty saw who they were, the chalk whichColonel Piercey thought she was capable of using to play her part,yielded to a crimson so hot and vivid that its truth and reality werethoroughly proved. She half rose, too, then sat down again moredeterminedly than before.“Mrs. Piercey,” said Margaret, “we saw you, and I could not pass youwithout a word.”“You are very kind, I am sure, Margaret Osborne; but you could have leftyour table very well without coming near me.”“Yes, perhaps,” said Margaret; “I should have said that, seeing youalone----”“Oh, if I am alone it is my own fault!” cried Patty, with a heat ofangry despair which almost took away her voice. Then it occurred to herthat to show this passion was to lessen herself in the eyes of those towhom she most wished to appear happy and great. She forced her cry ofrage into a little affected laugh. “I don’t often come here,” she said;“I dine generally in my own apartments. But to-day I expected friendswho could not come, and so I thought I’d amuse myself by coming downhere to see the wild beasts feed.”As she said this, her eyes fell accidentally upon the kind lady who hadmade up her mind to make the acquaintance of this forlorn little woman,and startled that amiable person so that she sat gazing open-mouthed andopen-eyed.“In that case I am afraid I am only intruding,” said Margaret; “but Ithought perhaps--if you are alone here, I--or my husband,” she addedthis with a sudden blush and smile, “might have been of some use----”“Oh, your husband! I wish him joy, I am sure. So you stuck to him,though he hasn’t got Greyshott? Well, he’ll have the baronetcy, to besure, when the old man dies--I hadn’t thought of that--without a penny!You must have been dead set on him, to be sure.”And Patty, bursting with fury and despite, jumped up, almost oversettingthe table, and with a wave of her hand as if dismissing a supplicant,but with none of her usual regard for her dignity and her dress inthreading a crowd, hurried away.“You got rather more than you looked for,” cried Colonel Piercey,triumphant, as Margaret came back to him and hastily took his arm. Hehad not heard what passed.“I suppose there was nothing else to be expected,” Margaret said in asubdued voice.Patty went to the opera that night, as she had intended, her heartalmost bursting; for that she should have hoped to meet somebody whowould introduce and help her, and then to find that somebody wasMargaret Osborne, was almost more than she could bear; but soon she wassoothed by perceiving that more opera-glasses were fixed on her thanever, and that the people in the boxes opposite, and in the stalls, werepointing her out to one another. She caught the sound of her own name asshe sat well forward in her box, that her diamonds might be well seenand her own charms appreciated; and she almost forgot the indignity towhich she had been, as she thought, subjected. But as she went out, poorPatty could not but hear some remarks which were not intended for herear. “That was the woman,” somebody said, “the heroine of the greatcase, Piercey _versus_ Piercey; don’t you remember? the woman whomarried an idiot, and then got his father to leave her all theproperty.” “What a horror!” said the lady addressed: “a barmaid, wasn’tshe? and the poor creature she married quite imbecile--and now to comeand plant herself there in the front of a box. Does she think anybodywill take any notice of her, I wonder?” “Impudent little face, butrather broken down--begins to see it won’t pay,” said another man.Patty caught Robert, her footman, by the arm, and shrieked to him totake her out of this, or she should faint, which the crowd around tookfor an exclamation of real despair, and made way for the lady, to lether get to the air. And Patty left town next day.CHAPTER XLVII.She left town next day in a tempest of wrath and indignation, andsomething like despair. She said to herself that she would go home,where no one would dare to insult her. Home! where, indeed, there wouldbe nobody to insult her, but nobody to care for her; to remark upon hereven in that contemptuous way; to say a word even of reprobation. Astrong sense of injustice was in her soul. I am strongly of opinion thatwhen any of us commits a great sin, it immediately becomes the mostnatural, even normal thing in our own eyes; that we are convinced thatmost people have done the same, only have not been found out; and thatthe opinion of the world against it is either purely fictitious, apretence of superior virtue, or else the result of prejudice or personalhostility. Patty had not committed any great sin. She had sought her ownaggrandisement, as most people do, but she had gained wealth andgrandeur far above her hopes by nothing that could be called wrong;indeed, she had done her duty in the position in which Providence andher own exertions had placed her. It was not her business to look afterthe interests of the Piercey family, but to take gratefully what wasgiven her, which she had the best of right to, because it had been givenher. This was Patty’s argument, and it would be difficult to find faultwith it. And to think that the whole cruel world should turn upon herfor that; all those gentlefolks whom she despised with the full force ofdemocratic rage against people who supposed themselves her betters, yetfelt to the bottom of her heart to be the only arbiters of socialelevation and happiness, the only people about whose opinion she cared!She came back to Greyshott in a subdued transport of almost tragicpassion. She would seek them no more, neither their approval nor theircompany. She would go back to her own class, to the class from which shehad sprung, who would neither scorn her nor patronise her, but fillGreyshott with admiring voices and adulation, and make her feel herselfthe greatest lady and the most beneficent. She called for Aunt Patienceon her way from the station and carried her back to Greyshott. “You’regoing to stay this time,” she said; “I mean to live in my own way, andhave my old friends about me; and I don’t care that,” and Patty snappedher fingers, “for what the county may say.”“The county couldn’t say nothing against your having me with you,Patty--only right, everybody would say, and you so young, and men comingand going.”“Where are the men coming and going?” said Patty; “I see none of them.I dare say there would be plenty, though, if it wasn’t for the women,”she added, with a self-delusion dear to every woman upon whom societydoes not smile.“You take your oath of that!” said Miss Hewitt, who was naturally of thesame mind.“But I mean to think of them no more,” cried Patty; “the servants shallsay ‘not at home’ to any of those ladies as shows their face here! I’llbear it no longer! If they don’t like to call they can stay away,--whatis it to me? But I’m going to see my old friends and give dinners anddances to them that will really enjoy it!” Patty cried.Miss Hewitt looked very grave. “Who do you mean, Patty, by your oldfriends?” she said.“Who should I mean but the Fletchers and the Simmonses and the Pearsonsand the Smiths and the Higginbothams?” said Patty, running on till shewas out of breath.“Lord, Patty! you’d never think of that!” cried Miss Hewitt, horrified.“Why shouldn’t I?--they’d be thankful and they’d enjoy themselves; andI’d have folks of my own kind about me as good as anybody.”“Oh, Patty, Patty, has it come to that? But you’re in a temper and don’tmean it,” Aunt Patience cried.It would, perhaps, have been better for this disinterested relation hadshe supported Patty in her new fancy, as undoubtedly it would have beenglorious and delightful to herself to have posed before her own villageassociates as one of the mistresses of Greyshott. But Miss Hewitt hadbeen influenced all her life by that desire for the society of theladies and gentlemen which is so strong in the bosom of the democrateverywhere. She could not bear that Patty should demean herself byfalling back upon “the rabble”; and many discussions ensued, in whichthe elder lady had the better of the argument. Patty’s passionate desireto be revenged upon the people who had slighted her resolved itself atlast into the heroic conception of such a fête for the tenants andpeasantry as had never been known in the county before. Indeed, thecounty was not very forward in such matters; it was an old-fashioned,easy-going district, and new ways and new education had made but smallprogress in it as yet. The squires and the gentry generally had notbegun to feel that necessity for conciliating their poorer neighbours,with whom at present they dwelt in great amity--which has now become ahabit of society. And the fame of the great proceedings at Greyshotttravelled like fire and flame across the county. No expense was sparedupon that wonderful fête. Patty knew exactly what her old friends andcompanions liked in the way of entertainment. She made a little speechat the dinner, which began the proceedings, to the effect that she hadnot invited any of the fine folks to walk about and watch them as ifthey were wild beasts feeding (using over again in a reverse sense themetaphor which she had already found so effectual), but preferred thatthey should feel that she was trusting them like friends and wishedthem to enjoy themselves. And to see Patty and Miss Hewitt walkingabout, sweeping the long trains of their dresses over the turf in themidst of these revellers, with a graciousness and patronage which wouldhave made Lady Hartmore open her eyes, was a sight indeed. No PrincessRoyal could have been more certain of her superior place than Patty onthis supreme occasion, when, flying from the hateful aristocrats, whowould not call upon her, she had intended to throw herself back againinto the bosom of her own class. And Miss Hewitt looked a Grand Duchessat the least, and showed a benign interest in the villagers which noreigning lady could have surpassed. “Seven? have you really? and suchfine children; and is this the youngest?” she said, pausing before afamily group; to the awe of the parents, who had known old PatienceHewitt all their lives, and knew that she knew every detail of theirlittle history; but this will show with what gusto and fine histrionicpower she was able, though really almost an old woman, to take up andplay her part. But had it not been the ideal and hope of her life?There was, however, one person at the Greyshott fête whom it wasdifficult to identify with the heroes of the village. When Patty sawapproaching her across the greensward a well-knit manly figure inirreproachable flannels, with a striped cap of red and white on hishead, a tie of the same colour, a fine white flannel shirt encirclingwith its spotless folded-down collar a throat burnt to a brilliantred-brown by the sun, her heart gave a jump with the sudden convictionthat “a gentleman” had come, even though uninvited, to see her in herglory. It gave another jump, however, still more excited and tremulous,when this figure turned out to be Roger Pearson--not a gentleman indeed,but a famous personage all over England, the pride of the county, whoserise in the world was now fully known to her. She had seen him before,indeed, in this costume, but only in the dusk, when it was not soclearly apparent. How well it became him, and what a fine fellow helooked! handsome, free, independent, as different from all his rusticfriends as Patty was from her old school-fellows in their cottondresses, but in how different a way; for Roger, it was well known, washand-and-glove with many of the greatest people of England, and yetquite at home in the village eleven which he had come to lead in thematch which was one of the features of the day. Patty, though she wasthe lady of Greyshott, could not but feel a pang of delight and pridewhen he walked by her side through the crowd. He was the only one whomshe could not patronise. She thought furtively that any one who saw themwould think he was the young squire; that was what he looked like--themaster, as she was the lady. He had no need to put on those airs whichPatty assumed. Nobody disputed his superiority, or even looked as ifthey felt themselves as good as him. And it seemed to be natural, as theafternoon went on, that he should find himself again and again byPatty’s side, sometimes suggesting something new, sometimes offeringhis services to carry out her plans, sometimes begging that she wouldrest and not wear herself out. “Go and sit down quiet a bit, and I’lllook after ’em; I can see you’re doing too much,” he said. It was takinga great deal upon him, Miss Hewitt thought, but Patty liked it! She gavehim commissions to do this and that for her, and looked on with the mostunaccustomed warmth at her heart while he fulfilled them. Just like theyoung master! always traceable wherever he moved in the whiteness of hisdress, that dress which the gentlemen wore and looked their best in; andnobody could have imagined that Roger Pearson was not a gentleman, tosee him. “Well! and weren’t there ways of making him one?” Patty thoughtto herself.But, notwithstanding her indignant determination to throw herself backinto the bosom of her own class, it was to Roger alone that she made anyovertures of further intercourse. He stayed behind all the others whenthe troops of guests went away, and told her it was a real plucky thingto do, and had been a first-rate success. He looked, indeed, like agentleman, but he had not adopted the phraseology of the Vere de Veres;and perhaps Patty liked him all the better. She said, “Come and see meany day; come when you like,” when he held her hand to say good-night;and she said it in an undertone, so that Aunt Patience might not hear.“I will indeed,” he said in the same tone, “the first vacant day Ihave----” Her breast swelled to see that he was a man much soughtafter, though this had not been her own fate.But either he did not have a vacant day, or, what Patty’s judgment quiteapproved, he did not mean to make himself cheap. And Patty fell into aworse depth of solitude than ever, notwithstanding the presence of AuntPatience, to whom she had said in the rashness of her passion that sheshould henceforth stay always at Greyshott, but whom now she felt to bean additional burden when perpetually by her side. There had been alittle quarrel between them after luncheon one day in July, for theywere both irritable by reason of that unbroken _tête-à-tête_, and of thefact that they had said ten or twelve times over everything they had tosay; and Miss Hewitt had flounced off upstairs to her room, where, afterher passion blew off, she had lain down on the sofa to take a nap,leaving Patty to unmitigated solitude. It was raining, and that made itmore dreary than ever: rain in July, quiet, persistent, downpouring;bursting the flowers to pieces; scattering the leaves of the last roseson the ground; and injuring even those sturdy uninteresting geraniumswhich are the gardener’s stand-by--is the dreariest of all rains. It isout of season, even when it is wanted for the country, as there isalways some philosopher to tell us; and it is pitiless, pattering uponthe trees, soaking the grass, spreading about us a remorseless curtainof grey. Patty, all alone, walked from window to window and saw nothingbut the trees under the rain, and a little yellow river pouring acrossthe path. She sat down and took up the work with which Aunt Patiencesolaced the weary hours. It was the old-fashioned Berlin woolwork, whichonly old ladies do nowadays. She contrived to put it all wrong, and thenshe threw it down and went to the window again. And then she was awareof a figure coming up the avenue, a figure clothed in a glistening whitemackintosh and under an umbrella. She could not see who it was, butsomething in the walk struck her as familiar. It looked like agentleman, she said to herself; though to be sure, in these days ofequality, it might be only the draper’s young man with patterns, or thelawyer’s clerk. Patty felt that she would have been glad to see even thelawyer’s clerk.But when it was Roger Pearson that came into the room, what a differencethat made at once! It was almost as if the sun had come out from behindthe clouds for a moment, although he was not a gentleman, but only aprofessional cricketer. He was not dressed this time in his flannels,which suited him best, but in a grey suit, which, however, was verypresentable. Patty felt that if the first lady in the county was tochoose this particular wet day to call, which was not likely, she wouldnot need to blush for her visitor. And she was unfeignedly glad to seehim in the desolation of her solitude. She could tell from the manner inwhich he looked at her that he was admiring her, and he could tell thatshe was admiring him, and what could two young people require more ofeach other? Roger told her quite frankly a great deal about himself. Heacknowledged that he had been “a bit idle” in his earlier days, andliked play better than work; but that had all come in very useful, forsuch play was now his work, and he had a very pleasant life, going allover the country to cricket matches, and seeing everything that wasgoing. “And all among the swells, too,” he said, “which would pleaseyou.”“Indeed, you’re mistaken altogether,” said Patty. “Swells! I loathe thevery name of them. Since I’ve lived among ’em I know what they are; anda poorer, more cold, stuck-up, self-seeking set----”“I don’t make no such objections,” said Roger, who, it has been said,took no trouble to use the language of gentlemen. “They’re good fellowsenough. I don’t want no more of them than they’re willing to give me--sowe gets on first rate.”“They try to crush your spirit,” cried Patty, flaming, “and then,perhaps, when they’ve got you well under their fist, they’ll condescendto take a little notice. But none of that sort of thing for me!”“Well!” said Roger, looking round him, “this is a fine sort of a place,with all these mirrors and gilt things; but I should have said you wouldhave been more comfortable with a smaller house, and things more in ourown way, like what we’ve been used to, both you and me.”“I have been used to this for a long time now,” said Patty, with spirit,“and it’s my own house.”“Yes, I know,” he said, “and it ain’t for me to say anything, for I’mnot a swell like these as you have such a high opinion of.”“I have no high opinion of them. I hate them!” cried Patty, with setteeth.“Well, I’ve often thought,” said Roger, “though I know I’ve no rightto--but just in fancy don’t you know--as Patty Hewitt of the SevenThorns would have been a happier woman in the nice little ’ouse as Icould give her now, and never harming nobody, than a grand lady likeMrs. Piercey, with so much trouble as you have had, and no realfriends.”“How do you know,” cried Patty, “that I have no friends?” and then,after a moment’s struggle to keep her self-command, she burst into aviolent storm of tears. “Oh, don’t say anything to me!” she cried,“don’t say anything to me! I haven’t had a kind word from a soul, norknown what it was to have an easy heart or a bit of pleasure, not sincethe night you came to the little door, Roger Pearson--no, nor longbefore.”There was a silence, broken only by her passionate sobs and the sound ofthe weeping which she could not control, until Roger moved from hischair and went up to the sofa on which she had thrown herself, hidingher tears and flushed face upon the cushions. He laid his hand upon hershoulder with a caressing touch, and said, softly, “Don’t now, don’tnow, Patty dear. Don’t cry, there’s a love.”“And when you think all I’ve gone through,” said Patty, among her sobs,“and how I’ve given up everything to do my duty! When you said to methat night you had been at a dance--Oh! and me never seeing a soul,never anything but waiting on them, and serving them, and nursing them,or playing nonsense games from morning to night! And then when the oldgentleman died and left me what I never asked him for, then everybodytaking up against me as if I had committed a sin; and never one comingnear me, never, never one, but Meg in London coming to speak out ofcharity, because I was alone. Yes, and I was alone,” said Patty, raisingherself up, drying her eyes hastily, with a nervous hand, “and I’ll bealone all my life; but I’ll never take charity as if I was some poorcreature, from her or from him!”“You needn’t be alone a moment more than you like, Patty,” said Roger.“I was always fond of you, you well know. You jilted me to marry _'im_,poor fellow, but I’ll not say a word about that. You’re not ’appy inthis great ’ouse, and you know it, nor you’ll never be. I’m not sayinganything one way or another about them ladies and swells: maybe theymight have been a little kinder and done no ’arm. But you’re aninterloper among them, you know you are; and I’m not one as ’olds withputting another man’s nose out of joint, or taking his ’ouse over ’is’ead. I wouldn’t, if it was a bit of a cottage, or your father’s oldplace at the Seven Thorns; and no more would I here. There ain’t noblessing on it, that’s my opinion.”“I don’t know, Roger Pearson, that your opinion was ever asked,” Pattysaid.“It wasn’t asked; but you wouldn’t cry like that before anybody but me,nor own as you were in trouble. Now, ’ere’s my ’and, if you’ll have it,Patty; I’ll not come ’ere to sit down at another man’s fireside, butI’ll stand by you through thick and thin; and I’m making a pretty bit ofmoney myself, and neither me nor you--we don’t need to be beholdin’ tonobody. Let’s just set up a snug place of our own, and I’d like to seethe man--the biggest swell in the world--or woman either, that would puta slight upon my wife.”“What!” said Patty, with a smile that was meant to be satirical, “giveup Greyshott and my position and all as I’ve struggled so hard for, foryou, Roger Pearson? Why, who are you? nobody! a man as is a goodcricketer; and that’s the whole when all’s said.”“Well,” said Roger, good-humouredly, “it’s not a great deal, perhaps,but it’s always something; and it’s still me if I never touched a bat.You wouldn’t marry my cricketing any more than you’d marry hisparliamenteering, or sporting, or what not, if you did get a swell; andyou take my word, Patty, you’ll never get on with a swell like you woulddo with me. We’ve been brought up the same, and we understand eachother. I know how you’re feeling, just exactly, my poor little girl:you’d like to be ’appy, and then pride comes in. You say, ‘I’ve workedhard for it and I’ll never give it up.’”“If you mean I’ll not give up being Mrs. Piercey of Greyshott, with thefinest house in the county, to go to a cottage with you----”“Don’t now, don’t,” said Roger, protesting, yet without excitement; “Inever said a cottage, did I? What I said was a ’andsome ’ouse, with allthe modern improvements and furnished to your fancy, instead of this oldbarrack of a place, and a spanking pair of ’osses, a deal better thanthem old fat beasts, as goes along like snails; and some more in thestable, a brougham, and a victoria, and a dogcart for me; that’s mystyle. I don’t call that love in a cottage. I call it love very well todo, with everything comfortable. Lord! if you like this better, this oldplace--full of ghosts and dead folks’ pictures, I don’t agree with yourtaste, my dear, and that’s all I’ve got to say.”Patty looked at her matter-of-fact lover, raising her head high,preparing the sharpest speeches. She sat very upright, all the tearsover, ready, quite ready, to give him his answer. But then theresuddenly came over Patty a vision of the winter which was coming, thewinter that would be just like the last--the monotonous, dreadful days,the long, lingering, mortal nights, with Aunt Patience for her solecompanion. And her thoughts leapt on before to the ’andsome ’ouse; forbeing, as Roger said, of his kind, and understanding by nature what hemeant, her imagination represented to her in a flash as of sunshine,that shining, brilliant, high-coloured house--with all the lastimprovements and the newest fashions, plate-glass windows, shining freshpaint which it would be a delight to keep like a new pin, everythingnew, clean, delightful; carpets and curtains of her own choosing,costing a great deal of money, and of which she could say to everyguest, “It’s the best that money could buy,” or “I gave so much a yardfor it,” or “Every window stands me in fifty pounds there as you seeit.” All this appeared to Patty in a flash of roseate colour. And thepair of spanking horses at the door, and a crowd of cricketing men, yes,and cricketing ladies; and meetings in her own grounds, and greatluncheon parties, and quantities of other young couples thinking ofnothing but their fun and their pleasure, the wives dressing againsteach other, the young men competing in their batting and bowling, and intheir horses and turn-outs, but all in the easiest, noisiest, friendlyway, and all surrounding herself, Patty, with admiration and homage asthe richest among them. Oh, what a contrast to grey old Greyshott, withits empty, echoing rooms and its dark solitude, and the pictures of deadpeople, as Roger said, and not a lively sight or sound, nothing butJerningham and the other servants and Aunt Patience. To think of allthat, and Roger added to it,--Roger, who sat looking at her so kindly,with his handsome good-humoured face, not hurrying her in her decision,looking as if he knew beforehand that she could not resist him and hisoffer of everything she liked best in the world.All this came to Patty in a moment, as she sat with her sharp speechesall arrested on her lips. The pause she made was not long, but it waslong enough to show him that she had begun to think, and we all knowthat the woman who deliberates is lost; and it was in the nature of thepractical-minded lover, who was not given to the sentimental, as it wasalso in Patty’s nature, to carry things by a _coup de main_. He sprangup from the seat he had taken opposite to her, and suddenly, before shewas aware, gave Patty a hearty kiss which seemed to sound through allthe silent house.“Don’t you think any more about it,” he said, holding her fast; “youjilted me before, but you’re not going to jilt me again. I ’ave the’ouse in my eye, and I know the jolly life we’ll live in it: lots ofcompany and lots of fun, and two folks that is fond of one another;that’s better than living all alone--a little more grand, but no fun atall.”And to such a triumphant and convincing argument, which her heart andevery faculty acknowledged, what could Patty reply?CHAPTER XLVIII.It was only a few weeks after this that there appeared in thenewspapers, which had all reported at such length the great trial ofPiercey _versus_ Piercey, a paragraph which perhaps caused as muchcommotion through the county as the news of any great public event formany years. Parliament had risen, and the papers were very thankful fora new sensation of any kind. The paragraph was to this effect:--“Our readers have not forgotten the trial of Piercey _v._ Piercey, whichunfolded so curious a page of family history, and roused so manycomments through the whole English-speaking world. It is seldom that somany elements of human interest are collected in a single case, and theeffect it produced on the immense audience which followed itsdevelopments day by day was extraordinary. The public took sides, as onan affair of imperial importance, for and against the heroine, who, fromthe bar-room of a roadside inn, found herself elevated in a single yearto the position of a considerable landowner, with an ancient historicalhouse and a name well known in the annals of the country. How sheattained these honours, whether by the most worthy and admirable means,by unquestionable self-devotion to her husband and father-in-law, or byundue influence, exercised first on a young man of feeble intellect, andafterwards on an old gentleman in his dotage, was the question debatedin almost every sociable assembly.“The partisans and opponents of this lady will have a new problemoffered to them in the new and startling incident which is now announcedas the climax of this story. Those who have all along believed in thedisinterestedness of the young and charming Mrs. Piercey will bedelighted to hear that she has now presented herself again before thepublic, in the most romantic and attractive light by freely and of herown will resigning the Manor of Greyshott, to which a jury of hercountrymen had decided her to be fully entitled, to the heirs-at-law ofthe late Sir Giles Piercey, together with all the old furniture,pictures, family plate, etc., contained in the manor house--a giftequally magnificent and unexpected. It is now stated that this has allalong been Mrs. Piercey’s intention, and that but for the trial, whichput her at once on her defence, she would have made this magnanimousrenunciation immediately after coming into the property. Her rightshaving been assailed, however, it is natural that a high-spirited youngwoman should have felt it her first duty to vindicate her character; andthat she should now carry out her high-minded intention, after all theobloquy which it has been attempted to throw on her, and the basemotives imputed to her, is a remarkable instance of magnanimity which,indeed, we know nothing to equal. It is, indeed, heaping coals of fireon the heads of her accusers, for whom, however, it must be said thattheir irritation in finding themselves so unexpectedly deprived of theinheritance they had confidently expected, was natural and justifiable.It must be a satisfaction to all that a _cause célèbre_ which attractedso much attention should end in such a fine act of restitution, and thatan ancient family should thus be restored to their ancestral place. Weare delighted to add that Mrs. Piercey, who still retains a fine fortunebequeathed to her by the love and gratitude of her father-in-law, whomshe nursed with the greatest devotion till his death, is about tocontract a second marriage with a gentleman very well known in thecricketing world.”“In the name of Heaven, what is the meaning of that?” cried old SirFrancis Piercey, who was a choleric old gentleman, flinging down thenewspaper (which only arrived in the evening), and turning a crimsoncountenance, flushed with astonishment and offence, to his son Geraldand his daughter-in-law Margaret, who had returned to their home in thenorth only a few days before. Sir Francis was a very peppery old man,and constantly thought, as do many heads of houses conscious of havinggrown a little hard of hearing, that nothing was told him, and that evenin respect to the events most interesting to the family he wassystematically kept in the dark.“The meaning of what?” Margaret asked, without excitement. She had nonewspaper, being quite content to wait for the news until the gentlemenhad read everything and contemptuously flung down each his journal withthe remark that there was nothing in it. Mrs. Gerald Piercey did notimagine there could ever be anything in the paper which could concernher or her belongings; and it was a quiet time in politics, whenParliament was up, and nothing very stirring to be expected. She rose toput down by her father-in-law’s side his cup of tea; for though he wasso fiery an old gentleman, he loved the little feminine attentions ofwhich he had been for many years deprived.“Let me see, Grandpapa,” said Osy, coming to the front with the air of aman who could put all straight.“By Jove!” cried Colonel Piercey, who had come to the same startlingannouncement in his paper. And the father and son for a moment sat boltupright, staring at each other as if each supposed the other to be toblame.“What is it?” said Margaret, beginning to be alarmed.She was answered by the sudden opening of the door, and the entrance,announced by a servant quite unacquainted with him, who conferred uponhim an incomprehensible name, of Mr. Pownceby, pale with excitement andtired with a journey. He scarcely took time for the ceremonioussalutations which Sir Francis Piercey thought needful, and omittedaltogether the “how-d’ye-do’s” owing to his old friends, Margaret andGerald, but burst at once into the subject that possessed him. “Well, Ican see you’ve seen it! Sharp work putting it in so soon; but it’s alltrue.”“What is all true? We have something to do with its being false or true,I suppose?” cried Colonel Piercey, placing himself in a somewhat defiantattitude, in an Englishman’s usual position of defence before the fire.“What are you saying, sir? what are you saying? I am a little hard ofhearing. I desire that all this should be explained to me immediately.You seem all to understand, but not a syllable has reached my ears.”“I assure you, Sir Francis,” said Mr. Pownceby, “I started the firstthing this morning. I have not let the grass grow under my feet. Hersolicitors communicated with me only yesterday. It is sharp work gettingit into the papers at once, very sharp work, but I suppose she wanted toget the honour and glory; and it is quite true. I have the deed in mypocket in full form; for those solicitors of hers, if not endowed withjust the best fame in the profession, are----”“But you’re going a great deal too fast, Pownceby,” cried ColonelGerald. “I don’t see that either my father or I can accept anything fromthat woman’s hand.”“The deed in full form, Sir Francis,” said the lawyer, too wise to takeany notice of so hotheaded a person, “restoring Greyshott and all thatis in it to the lawful heir--yourself. I don’t pretend to know what isher motive; but there it is all in black and white: and for once in away I can’t but say that I admire the woman, Sir Francis, and thatshe’s got perception of what is right in her, after all.”“God bless my soul!” was all Sir Francis said.“But we can’t take it from that woman, Pownceby! Why, what are youthinking of? Receive from her, a person we all despise, a gift likethis! Why, the thing is impossible! It is like her impertinence to offerit; and how you could think for a moment----”Margaret, who had hastily taken up the paper and read the paragraph,here put it down again and laid her hand on her husband’s arm. “You mustwait,” she said, “you must wait, Gerald, for what your father says.”“The woman of the trial?” said Sir Francis, getting it with difficultyinto his head, “the baggage that married poor Gervase, and made a foolof his father--that woman!” He added briskly, turning to his son: “I wasalways against that trial, you know I was. Don’t throw away good moneyafter bad, I always said: let be; if we don’t get it in the course ofnature we’ll never get it, was what I always said. You know I alwayssaid it. Those costs which you ran up in spite of me, almost broke myheart.”There was a pause, and then Colonel Piercey said with a half laugh, “Weall know, father, that you did not like the costs.”“I said so!” said Sir Francis, “I was always against it. I thought thewoman might turn out better than you supposed. A very remarkable thing,Mr. Pownceby, don’t you think it’s a very remarkable thing? after shehad won her cause and had everything her own way. Do you recall tomemory ever having heard of a similar incident? I never did in all myexperience; a very extraordinary thing indeed!”“No,” said Mr. Pownceby, “no; I don’t think I ever did hear anythinglike it. They generally stick to what they have got like grim death.”“I think that must be rather a remarkable woman,” said Sir Francis; “Iretract anything I may have been induced to say of her in a moment ofannoyance. I consider she has acted very creditably, very--very--I maysay nobly, Mr. Pownceby. I beg that I may never hear a word in herdisparagement from any of you. I hope that we might all be capable ofdoing anything so--so--magnanimous and high-minded ourselves.”“But, father,” cried Colonel Piercey, “we can’t surely accept a giftlike this from a woman we know nothing of--whom we’ve no esteemfor--whom we’ve prosecuted--whom----”“Not accept it, sir?” cried Sir Francis--“not accept a righteousrestitution? I should like to know on what principle we could refuse it?If a man had taken your watch from you, would you refuse to take it ifhe brought it back? Why, what would that be but to discourage every goodimpulse? I shall certainly accept it. And I hope, Mr. Pownceby, that youwill convey my thanks--yes, my thanks, and very high appreciation tothis young lady. I think she is doing a very noble thing. Whether Ibenefited by it or not, I should think it a very noble thing. Don’t bestingy in your praise, sir! It’s noble to say you’ve been wrong--manyhaven’t the strength of mind to do it. I’ll drink her very good healthat dinner. We’ll have a toast, do you hear?”“Yes, Grandpapa,” cried Osy, always ready; “and shall it be with whatCousin Colonel calls the honours? You give the name, and I’ll stand upupon a chair and do the ‘Hip, hip, hurrah!’”Upon what rule it was that old Sir Francis, rather a severe oldgentleman to most people, had become grandpapa to Osy, while ColonelPiercey remained only, as of old, Cousin Colonel, is too subtle aquestion to enter into; but it was so to the perfect satisfaction of thetwo persons chiefly involved. And thus for the second time Osy cheeredfor Patty with the delighted readiness of an unbiassed soul.Mrs. Piercey left Greyshott shortly after this, having left everythingin the most perfect good order, and all the servants in the house,without saying a word of any new arrangements, though I need not saythey had all read that paragraph in the newspapers. She went to London,where she spent a few weeks very pleasantly, and ordered a great manynew dresses. Here she dismissed Jerningham, who carried away with her anumber of black and white gowns, and the best recommendations. Pattyplunged into pinks and blues with the zest of a person who has long beendeprived of such indulgences, and the world learned by the newspapersthat, on the 20th of August, Patience, widow of the late GervasePiercey, Esq., of Greyshott, was married at St. George’s, HanoverSquare, to Roger Pearson, Esq., of Canterbury House. The happy pair wentabroad for their honeymoon, but did not enjoy the Continent, onlyentering into full and perfect bliss when they returned to theglistening glories of their new house. There had been various stormsbetween them before the question of Greyshott had been decided, and ithad required all Roger’s power and influence to carry his scheme to asuccessful conclusion. His determination not to sit down by anotherman’s fireside, and to have nothing to say to the old house, which hedeclared gave him the shivers to look at, were answered by many ascornful request to take himself off then, if he didn’t like it, andleave it to those who did.“That’s just what I want--to leave it to those that like it: you don’t,Patty, and never will!” cried the bold lover. “How do I know? Oh, Iknow! You’ve gone through a lot, and you think you’ll have something forit, anyhow. Well, so you shall have something for it. Wait till you seethe ’ouse that is just waiting till you say the word--ten times betteran ’ouse, and folks all about us will be delighted to see you, and asmuch fun as you can set your face to!” Oh, how powerful and how sweetthese arguments were! But to give Greyshott back was a bitter pill toPatty.“I’ll sell it, then,” she said; “it’ll bring in a deal of money;” andthis was what Miss Hewitt, who was almost mad with opposition, advised,arguing and beseeching till the foam flew from her mouth.But Roger was obstinate. He declared that he would not be instrumentalin taking any man’s home from him. “Money’s a different thing,” he said.“One sovereign’s just like another, but one ’ouse ain’t like another.”The telling argument, however, was one which Roger had the cleverness topick up from a cricket reporter on a daily paper, to whom he hadconfided his romance.“By George!” cried the journalist, “what a paragraph for my paper!” Hesaid “par,” no doubt, but Patty would not have understood what thismeant. When she did take up the idea, and understood that her praiseswere to be sung and her generosity extolled in every paper, and that thePierceys would be made to sing small before her, Patty was overcome atlast. Her heart swelled as if it would burst with triumph and a sense ofgreatness when she read that paragraph. She felt it to be altogetherjust and true. If they had not prosecuted, there was no telling whatmagnanimity she might not have been equal to, and she accepted thepraise as one who had deserved it to the very utmost.“They’ve been in it hundreds and hundreds of years,” she said to the newfriends to whom her bridegroom introduced her in London--among whom wereseveral newspaper men, and one who insisted upon getting her portraitfor an illustrated paper--“as we have been in the Seven Thorns. Being ofan old family myself, I have always felt for them.” This was reported inthe little biographical notice which was appended to Mrs. Piercey’sportrait in the illustrated paper, where it was also told that she hadbeen known far and wide as the Lily of the Seven Thorns, and had beencarried off by the Squire’s son from many competitors. It made up formuch, even for the fact, still bitter to her, that she had been cheatedout of her title, and would never be Lady Piercey,--a loss and delusionwhich sometimes brought tears into her eyes long after she was RogerPearson’s wife.But when Patty settled down in her own ’Andsome ’Ouse, it was soonproved that Roger had not said a word too much. The cricketing worldrallied round him. He ceased to be a professional, and became agentleman cricketer and a member of the M.C.C. The cricket pitch withinthe grounds of Canterbury House was admirable, and matches were playedthere, in which not only the honour of the county, but the honour ofEngland, was involved. Patty gave cricket luncheons and even cricketdinners, to which the golden youth of England came gladly, and whereeven great ladies, watching the cricket for one side or another, werecontent to be entertained. Patty drove her two spanking horses over thecounty, calling at the best houses; while even Lady Hartmore, after therestitution as she called it, paid her a visit of ceremony, which Mrs.Roger Pearson, swelling with pride and triumph, never returned. Not tohave returned Lady Hartmore’s visit was almost as great a distinction asto have received one from the Queen. And all the lesser ladies in thecounty envied Patty the strength of mind which made her capable of sucha proof of independence.Colonel Piercey and his wife became shortly afterwards the inhabitantsof Greyshott, which suited Sir Francis better than to have hislong-accustomed quiet permanently disturbed. “Though I’d like to keepthe boy,” he said. It cost a good deal to Colonel Pierce’s pride, but itlay with his father to decide, and there was nothing more to say. Theywere not rich, for Greyshott was a difficult place to keep up on alimited income; but it was something, no doubt, after the shock of therestoration, to have the old house still.And Patty flourishes and spreads like a green baytree. She is not socareful of etiquette, so anxious to be always correct and do what otherladies do. She is beginning to grow stout; her colour is high; hernursery is full; and she is, beyond all question, a much happier womanthan she ever could have been in Greyshott, even had Lady Hartmorecalled and all gone well--now that she and her husband live in continualjollity in their own ’Andsome ’Ouse.                               THE END.
