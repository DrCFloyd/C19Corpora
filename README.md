## About the corpora

This repository houses three corpora I compiled while writing the last chapter of my dissertation. Two of these corpora were built using reference lists tabulated with Troy J. Bassett’s valuable <em>At the Circulating Library</em> database and supplemented them with texts which were suggested in response to a Twitter query. The first corpus, a positive control group, consisted of fifty-five novels featuring characters who are authors, editors, or publishers.⁠ This Author Character Corpus (ACC), as I’ve called it, includes fiction published between 1841 and 1900 by forty-two different authors (eighteen women and twenty-four men), and consists of works scraped from Project Gutenberg and the Internet Archive.  

I compiled the second corpus using only texts available on Project Gutenberg. This Victorian “Bestseller” Corpus (VBC), includes one-hundred novels and novellas published between 1870 and 1901 by twenty-five different authors (five women and twenty men). ⁠I use the term bestseller in scare quotes to call attention to the fact that there is no standard measure by which we designate a nineteenth-century work as a bestseller.⁠ 

I manually stripped all files in these corpora of paratextual material (such as tables of contents, publisher’s advertisements, and edition information) and, for the Internet Archive documents, used a program called BBEdit to identify and remove characters which are not readable in plain text. Although it declutters the document files, such cleaning does not address the problem of words which have been incorrectly identified or have gone altogether unrecognized by the OCR software. In fact, such errors typically require manual correction. Due to the scale of the corpus, individually correcting each novel-length plain-text file was out of the question for this project. This means that the data I obtained from the ACC are, while reliable, necessarily incomplete. Each novel included in the corpus was still largely readable enough to produce usable and meaningful data, but the numbers I provide for specific terms which appear in the corpus in the following section potentially underrepresent actual word frequency. 

The final corpus contained here is a collection of George Eliot's novel-length works. Ideally, I'd like to build it out to include all of her known work (some of which has not been digitized) within the parameters of public domain and copyright. Please add to this if you can!
